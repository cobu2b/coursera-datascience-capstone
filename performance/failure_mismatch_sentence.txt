He needs to find a doctor
Occasionally, and gratifyingly, I receive comments on posts written a while ago - such was the case a few days ago when I found this personal reminiscence of Henry McIlhenny on a post from November 2010. Coincidentally, more or less, in one of those rare moments when focus didn't cause peripheral blindness, I had found pictures of Mr McIlhenny's Glenveagh Castle in County Donegal when I was in the library looking for something else.
Like Epic Failure.
I don't blame the hospitals - obviously there is a huge cost factor. But you have to think of the health of the patients as well don't you?? They are all there because they are not that well, so being fed food and beverages in plastic that leaches Bisphenol-A really can't be helping their health.

For my book Sugar Daddy, I chose some Duran Duran, Depeche, as well as modern day hip-hop music because the story features a young gay man looking for the love of an older one.

One hundred and fifty years from now, Africa has become the worlds dominant technological and economic power. Crime, war, disease and poverty have been eliminated. The Moon and Mars are settled, and colonies stretch all the way out to the edge of the solar system. And Ocular, the largest scientific instrument in history, is about to make an epochal discovery
After our hike we stopped for lunch and then hit the road. We had just gotten into the Phoenix city limits when Athletica realized she didnt have her purse. I pulled into a gas station parking lot and we searched for it. No, it wasnt there. I called the restaurant in Sedona and sure enough they had it. I put some more gas into the car and turned north back onto the I-17. We headed back to Sedona. The staff recognized us from a few hours earlier. We decided to stay for some warm sopapillas and honey before heading home. We ended up missing the Superbowl and all the illustrious commercials but all in all, I would not have changed a single thing about this past weekend. When we left Sedona, the almost full moon illuminated the giant rocks below. There is no show that can compare. The adventure continues.

I wanted a fun activity for the end of the week and I really LOVE using visual arts to teach maths and to satisfy the curriculum outcomes. I was thinking of doing a guided drawing lesson using a character from a picture book, like the lesson I posted about here, but after some convincing from my own girls, we went with an Angry Birds theme!

We're down to two and a half weeks left of school. I am really looking forward to summer break. I'll still have to work to get things ready for next year, but at least I won't have to be in everyday.

What we do know is that hospitalizations for eating disorders in kids under 12 are up 119%, and research from the University of Minnesota found that weight control behaviors used by adolescents predicted significant weight gain in some kids and eating disorders in some kids but failed to produce thinner kids or healthier kids.
As we carry our precious cargo home enthusiastic sharing ensues. Ideas about egg dishes, soups, salads, savory meats rubbed with herbs are cheerily blurted. Senses stimulated with the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes of the edibles enrich our food experience even as they will soon invigorate our bodies.

The Canadian suffers from a rare lung and heart condition  pulmonary embolism. He has previously undergone two open-heart operations at the Ottawa Heart Institute and he requires constant medication. Around the time of arrest, his supply of medication, which he had brought from Canada, ran out. He has been without treatment for nearly four months now.
Instead Im annoyed that I see so few examples of FAAB gender-queer folk like myself that are not able to adopt a more masculinized/androgynous appearance in places set up to be welcoming to us. I realize that probably has more to do with how US culture frames body types and gender and what boxes we are all constrained within because of it, so no, Im not mad at the spaces themselves but more the framework we are all stuck to. If parts of that framework fit you and work for you and ease your pain, thats wonderful. Im very happy for you because I do have an idea of what its like to be trying to be something you arent. I just dont fit there, and Im getting tired of trying to find the next best thing because its still the wrong thing. Its like trying to sleep with sand in my bed.

On the international economic front, the situation on euro area markets improved somewhat compared with the stress peaks experienced in the closing months of 2011. Here, the ECBs conventional and non-conventional monetary policy measures contributed notably, as did the approval of the second bail-out programme for Greece following the restructuring of its debt in private hands and the progress in the ongoing reform of economic governance in the euro area. However, instability returned in the opening days of April, affecting Spain and Italy acutely owing to the doubts arising over the adjustment processes under way in both countries.
Im really loving using lime as the primary flavor enhancer. It wakes up produce (and the palate) without having to resort to sugar or salt. Better still, it makes me feel refreshed rather than deprived. This morning lime juice was the supporting player in a parfait reinterpretation of fruit salad. An award-winning performance, Id say, enough so that I expect to repeat it as soon as tomorrow.
For Carver fans, Altman doesn't render a faithful adaptation but merely uses the writer as a launching pad for this incredible work. The story that most closely resembles its Carver origins is the one based on "A Small, Good Thing," but the quick intercutting of the various tales slightly undermines its emotional payoff in the film. However, only readers of the story will probably notice.

And my other tip, learned in the recent workshop I took and wrote about here is to use a big jar for rinsing brushes during painting, filled with hot water. It dissolves the paint much faster and more thoroughly.

Rather than protest the extravagance, California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris instead has sued San Diego because she thinks transit was not favored enough in the plan and thereby violates the legislative planning requirements enacted in 2006 and 2008. Her predecessor (Jerry Brown, who is now the governor) similarly sued San Bernardino County in 2007.

Having lived in different regions of the country and sojourned in different English-speaking countries, I've long had a keen ear for differences in accent and pronunciation as well as word choice and syntax. I used to make a game of trying to guess the origin of an English-speaking person, but now it will be harder to do so, if accents keep being replaced by ''mass media English''.
I am going to place her in the new plot but in a small flint grotto overlooking the slope rather than on her back looking up at our dry sky. We could use a miracle.

I believe that we are living in a divided nation and this division is creating stress on everyone, as what was once common decency and mutual respect for differing opinions, has become a mud-slinging, gutter sniping, public evisceration of gotcha politics. The latest casualty is Rush Limbaugh, whose remarks have set off a fire storm on the left, calling for Limbaughs sponsors to drop him. Radio campaign next step against Rush Limbaugh  Washington Times
So, Im going to read it. I want to try to figure out why it has become so big and if its worthy of the hype. And its only book one of an erotic trilogy. I wonder if they will make these books into a film franchise to rival Twilight? Umm  maybe not a franchise for teens.
Just the worry of making sure a model would show up on time is tiring! I always have a moment after Alicia finishes up the makeup and hair, where I briefly freak out and say an inner, resounding "Don't fuck this up". Because at that point it's its really just up to me to prove to this model that she didn't waste her time driving over here on her day off. I feel like adding that bit of pressure is a good thing. Creative people thrive under pressure. So i woke up on Friday morning completely exhausted, having that oh-god-why-did-I-do-so-many-jobs-in-a-row-I'm-in-so-much-pain-right-now feeling. But I chugged some dayquil, took a couple pain pills and pushed through my last shoot at Griffith park. I was so sore, which made me realize that I do some strange poses when snapping shots. I'm flat on the ground, I'm hoping up on tables, I'm one legged against a wall. I must look very silly, but hey it gets the job done. I came back home on Saturday, feeling sick and I totally puked a couple times from exhaustion. hahah.. But everything went fairly smoothly.

Coming to know means "to place oneself in a conditional relation to something"; to feel oneself conditioned by something and oneself to condition it--it is therefore under all circumstances establishing, denoting, and making-conscious of conditions (not forthcoming entities, things, what is "in-itself").
Both. I wish I didnt have to sleep. I try to wring every last minute out of the day.
Now, weve moved on to medium. We just bought Pampers and Moony today, so well see how they work. One things for certain, the medium fits much better than the small. Pampers fits extremely well, and my wife said that shes probably a Pampers baby, meaning shes the right shape for them. The Moony diapers have an advantage, though. They have an elastic waste band. Well see how both brands hold up to leaks, and if they hold enough volume of poop.
for Gods sake, and its a nicely rounded off peak too,
How do we come to understand things? Understanding is cumulative. As a child I understood what love is. At least I believed I did. I loved and I was loved. I understood what that felt like. Only now Im in my fifties can I accept that my definition required significant adjustment and Im still not sure Im happy with how I define love. The same goes for loss. Ive lost pets, acquaintances, one friend that I know of, both parents but I havent  and hope I never do  lose my daughter. Ive misplaced her but she was never lost to me. So I dont understand what Thomse went through. And I never want to. I do understand his need to understand and why he would turn to words to help him. That is what appealed to me about this book: his struggle with language.
Thank You, God, for giving me the morning back.
Id like to think Im a good script writer, but I think there made better when I have REAL performers like Alex and Daisy performing them as opposed to people on my course.
But God understands them. God speaks that soul language, and more than that, God treasures every salty drop.
So for me to continue with my tale means I must be forced to step out of character and calmly relay the mixed emotions, the confusion and the shock.

All in all, a fun and relaxing weekend. Id intended to do some work on the old bike but the weather was WAY too nice here to stay cooped up in a garage, so decided to ride instead. Right now Im propped up on the couch with my laptop, watching the Dude play Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and trying to find the nerve to start writing again. Yup folks, this post is a handy-dandy procrastination tool and I shall wield it proudly within my golden grasp. Fear my procrastinating skills for they are LEGION!!!

Perhaps the best description I can think of for Anvil! is that its a cross between This is Spinal Tap and American Movie. But while there are plenty of laughs in Anvil! - some of which the subjects are probably unaware of  the movie is more about struggle and dedication, and less about laughing at talentless, self-deluded hacks. Steve Lips Kudlow and Robb Reiner, the heart and soul of the metal band Anvil, have been at it for 30 years, with one big flashpoint in the early 80s and a lot of playing at sports bars and in European dungeons for ten or twelve people a show. Though they occasionally show signs of giving up the rock n roll dream, they remain committed to staying together, making music, and hoping for that big break.

Crispy, golden, fried pizza dough, salty olives and capers, ooey-gooey melty cheese, zingy tomato sauce and a bit of spinach to let you think you're eating something healthy. Each panzarotti is like a little present you get to open with your mouth. And since the recipe makes about a dozen, it's the best kind of gift - the kind you get to share with others. Thanks to Nadia G. for sharing these with us.

In bringing these terms together highlighting augmentation and space Manovich aptly captured and synthesized two convergent digital developments: mobile / wireless / locative media and Augmented Reality. But this is only one side of the story hes telling us in this essay; an important part of it consists of an original reading of the history of visual arts as a history of expanding its display platforms from the gallery wall to the gallery space (installation art) to information space (interactive art), followed by diverse case studies of contemporary art, architecture, and urban design, ranging from Janet Cardiffs audio walks to diverse manifestations of the electronic vernacular including DigitalSky in Hongkong, Robert Venturis information surfaces and Rem Koolhaas NY Prada Store. These examples allow Manovich to recast augmentation from a purely technological definition to augmentation as a theoretical concept and as a cultural and aesthetic practice.
Adaptability to new electronic worlds is all very well, but it is nothing without a streak of hard conservatism. As writers we love neologisms, word play and the whole dazzling funfair of language as she is spoke and bespoke, but we also have a certain interest in stability. We would prefer a word at the end of a paragraph to retain much the same bundle of meanings that it had when it appeared at the beginning of it. We know about the modifications of meaning undergone by any word on its journey through text, and as writers it is our business to know that, but we do rely on the stability of the range.

The first indisputable contemporary evidence found during this study of Foster's commercial artistic activity is an advertisement that he placed in The Leeds Mercury of 17 June 1809. The words "By His Majesty's Royal Letters Patent" suggest that a Royal patent had been granted for the newly invented machine for sketching profiles in a short space of time, accurately and in great detail, although Foster in this particular case neither implicitly states that he was the inventor of the machine nor the grantee of the patent.
Our experience with the Japanese during the war was also a shared experience. Both citys were ravaged by the cruel occupation. One could find very beautiful memorials dedicated to the heroes and victims of the war around downtown. The strategical location of Manila and Singapur were ideal for just about everything, including serving as military bases for invading armies. Im hoping to find a good book about WWII events here in Singapore.

I started making them because I was really tired of going to the gaming store and only finding dice bags that would tip over and had a fabric selection that I just didnt find appealing. I know gamers like to personalize things, and I knew I could make something to serve that interest. This is why I also do custom orders. I just love it when I get a custom order bang on.

If youre anything like me then you will agree that wearing makeup all day can make your face feel dirty and weighed down. All too often though we are too tired and lazy to take our makeup off, thus causing breakouts and clogged pores. Of course a majority of girls wont admit to this, but hey I will! Noxzema is a brand that seems almost n0n-existent to the beauty world, but Ive been using this facial cleanser ever since I was a tween. Soaps are too harsh and getting out your daily soapy face wash is just too much work haha. Well, Ive got a solution for you that will make your face feel amazing and it will only take 30 seconds of your time. Good bye dirt, oil, and makeup!

Now we are going crazy about getting tickets. You won't find any information about how and where you can get tickets for this concert. The only thing we know is they will hold the concert at Tempodrom in Berlin. So we have to wait for new information. I think I will go crazy while waiting for the tickets will be sold. x_x
On Sunday morning at 8, before breakfast, we joined the friars for 'les laudes' - a short service of chanted hymns and psalms. It was magical. The church is a vast and resonant concrete cavern. Perhaps 18m high, around 40m long and 10m wide. The four sheer walls connected by the strata lines where the concrete was poured layer after layer. Bright coloured light filters through horizontal slits - these slope upwards through the massive walls, so that the window itself is not visible, just the painted surface inside the opening that reflects the light. The chanting of the seven friars filled the space completely. We tried to imagine how it must have sounded when there were 70 or 80 of them. It is a space that I found slightly oppressive initially - the concrete is almost overwhelming, the geometry of the space, particularly the north end, is not entirely comfortable - but when the friars sing it all makes sense. The volume, the material and the voices just work together.
I hope we'll be able to see these interviews and the filmed Betty MacDonald interview at the next Betty MacDonald Fan Club meeting.

Ok, I killed enough time before meeting my friend at his office. He invited me to a meet and greet lunch at the swank Nashville City Club. Well, its swank if you consider early 70s decor to be swank. It is a private dinner club in a Nashville penthouse and has been the location of a lot of moving and shaking for decades. However, I get the feeling that it is struggling to maintain its grandeur.

Well, there's a band called HORRID that plays Swedish death metal since 1990. Maybe they have never written a true masterpiece but they've stayed true since the beginning, and they're still active. Then we have ERODED (not to be confused with the German ERODED), which are really great. Their only two demos have been reprinted on CD and they're currently preparing a full-length record. PROFANAL must be mentioned as well, they're sweadeath-like and Dark Descent itself has just released their brand new split 7"! Furthermore, there are of course other killer, non-swedeath bands out there in Italy, but the main problem is not the lack of bands. The problem is, indeed, the organization and support a scene should have to be healthy.
My little school threw benefit horse shows each spring to raise money for our sports program before insurance forbade public fun and diving boards. In addition to allowing horses on our soccer field, we had a Jack Russell terrier as a school mascot. Bandit hung out in our classrooms in the days prior to chronic animal dander allergies. Childhood had more dog hair and philosophical potential before humans developed an intolerance for the same lead paint I used to nibble from my crib slats. I personally believe all the fun stopped when that douche with the coffee burns sued McDonalds and won. Liability has certainly taken the kick out of kids memories these days. Weve all turned into, like, total pussies.
After our visit, we had a final lunch with Patty. She was an outstanding trip leader and did a great job keeping everything organized.

I first became acquainted with this problem through the Regretsy website, where people often poke fun at really shitty craft projects and Steampunk crap being sold on Etsy. According to the offended crafters and thin-skinned wieners everywhere, having a negative opinion about something automatically makes one a fat, jealous loser. And probably also a cat lady. And a virgin. Maybe a lesbian, too, it really just depends on the offended party. No no, my personal opinion that your craft project sucks cannot possibly be based on the fact that your craft project does indeed suck. I only think your craft project sucks because Im so fat and jealous of your craft-making abilities that, naturally, the only way to cope with that jealousy is to insult something that is actually really really awesome.

So when one of my girls started asking to put on shoes first thing in the morning, I knew who she got it from. Kayla, would wake up, and go into her twin sisters closet and pick out a new pair every day, her own shoes are stacked up too high for her to reach.
On the wall above it, is my most favourite piece of delft blue ware, the Dutch coffee grinder. To the right on the bench I keep the salt pot, a container with a brush I use for dipping in oil and a spoon rest, again all in Delft blue. It was a hobby of mine to get things to go into my "Dutch" kitchen and follow the blue theme which took a quite some time over the last 10 years before we went on the pension. I'm glad I did now, as this is the part of the house we spend most of our time and it has become a comfortable place to work in amongst my little treasures. It's not a big kitchen but very functional and I love being in there."

The lower walls are fifteen feet, built with an angle tower by the McCarthys of Muskerry. It was subsequently occupied at one time by Cormac McCarthy, King of Munster, who is said to have supplied four thousand men from Munster to supplement the forces of Robert the Bruce at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Legend has it that the latter king gave half of the Stone of Scone to McCarthy in gratitude. This, now known as the Blarney Stone, was incorporated in the battlements where it can now be kissed.

Well, the tides turned when this friendly neighbor lost his house to foreclosure. I wish that on no one, but there are consequences to your actions, and he didnt lose the house to downsizing or a failing economic system. He lost it due to his own erratic and irresponsible behavior. Losing his house wasnt a shock to us, but what was a shock is how he moved out. He just left. And not only did he leave behind a crap hole for the bank to deal with, he left behind the horse and the two dogs trapped in a pen with no food or hay or water.
I reached the hotel, checked in and made it to my room. I consumed my delicious McDonald's dinner while flipping channels on the TV and trying to get connected to their wi-fi. It was about 8:30 now, and it was still coming down outside.

The reasons and who is to blame for all this chaos is all subjective. It is up to Ice Hockey UK to handle everything to do with the national team. From media and press to training camps and accommodation it is their responsibility. But surely they can only work with what they given. Meaning that the EIHLs season ended a week later than the previous year and so players were only released to the national team 6 days before the opening day of the World Championships. The EPL, who provided the coach, back up goalie and a centre, only ended their season on the opening day of the championships.
Granted early Christians were libelled repeatedly and not taken seriously by educated (and uneducated) Romans, but I think Tertullian is reacting with something other than love when he imagines his persecutors futures.

As a child living in the islands finding coral on the beach was my weekly goal. Forays in glass bottom boats to see coral and sea creatures such as urchins and sting rays was always on top of my list to things to do. I was never bored by going over and over, as the sea is forever changing.

I have also met some of the people with whom your sister is working, including two mothers who lost their daughters to adoption, one in a so called open adoption. I guess the fact that you lost your son to adoption puts you in the same category as these women. OH! THATS RIGHT! You still had him with you, didnt you? I guess that REMOVES you from that category.
The people in the coach behind us were also at the rally in Winston Salem and have lived here as full time RV'ers. She told me more about Pham, who calls the local cops if he suspects the strangest thing from the residents of the mobile home park on the hill. She says Pham is one in a million and I have already seen that. They sold their home near here and travel between Durham where one son lives and their other son in southern CA and visit family in FL along the way. Her husband is a retired computer program mer and says he picks up odd jobs along their travels to supplement their retirement.

Its like a car wreck you dont want to see anyone hurt but you cant help looking.
Lord Millner published his report in February 1921, in which he recommended the end of the Egyptian Protectorate. A year later, on 22nd February 1922, the British Government issued a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence; although they would continue to protect their interests with regard to the Suez Canal. On 15th March, Fouad proclaimed himself King of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur.

He tried to avoid it at first; but then laughed and said that after all, the matter was not worth concealment, so he would let me into the secret. In substance, this is his story:

These were the things almost all of them said they wished to do once all their life desires were fulfilled. And when asked why, all of them said mostly because they always wanted to do these things but are too busy fulfilling their dreams and desires. And they also said that if they do these things listed above, they will bring more meaning to their lives and feel they have accomplished something and make themselves worthwhile and meaningful. By doing these, it will bring them lot of happiness and peace.

What strikes me as super strange about this film first off is the notion that a bunch of birds and laddies on motorbikes can ride through workaday British shoppers and harass the locals and only one bobby e'er shows up to stop 'em. Special note to bakery delivery guys: don't try to walk across the lane with a stack of freshly baked bread while bikers are roaring their engines around, terrorizing the populace right outside your shop. And if you're up on a ladder in the middle of the lane, get down! Then again, reality is not high on the menu in PSYCHOMANIA. Instead it flatters the palate of the sugar-addicted adolescent, making up in vandalism and chipper death cult romance what it lacks in meat, fiber, and coherence.

They are 100% cotton and printed with earth friendly dyes. 4 different colors: milk chocolate, midnight black, snow white and fairy pink. 4 different styles: shorts sleeve- crew neck, short sleeve-v neck, 3/4 sleeve-crew neck, 3/4 sleeve-v neck. 4 different sayings: "take charge", "take notice", "take action" and "take control". I'm a "take control" fan. Take control of your thoughts, your feelings, your attitude, your life, your knitting stash!

Is it me? I sometimes don't quite follow the Author, Author pieces in Saturday's Guardian Review, those articles in which authors talk about their own take on the writing process. Maybe it's something to do with the essentially idiosyncratic nature of the writing process for each writer: either those authors are talking to themselves in their own private language, using their own private short-cut associations, or I'm so caught up in my own that I can't always relate to the whole of their arguments. On Saturday Adam Thirwell wrote about the difficulty of representing thoughts and psychology truthfully in novels, but if you can sort out the difference between the description in the first paragraph here and the intimate third person, or between the two modes in the two separate paragraphs, then you're brighter (or more patient, or less hung up on your own writing obsessions) than I:In an essay, I once wrote about how Franz Kafka invented a strange style in his novels about this man he called K: where, although it looks like a third-person narrative, it is in fact a disguised first-person narrative, belonging to K. And suddenly I thought that I understood more precisely why Kafka wanted to do this. It was a way of inventing a subterfuge, so that he could be true to the cloudiness of thoughts. In a diary entry, on January 12 1911, Kafka noted how he hadn't been writing much, partly because he was lazy, true, but also "because of the fear of betraying my self-perception". Because, he continued, if a thought cannot be written down "with the greatest completeness, with the incidental consequences, as well as with entire truthfulness" - which it couldn't - then what was written down would replace the vague thought "in such a way that the real feeling will disappear while the worthlessness of what has been noted down will be recognised too late". This is why Kafka needed to write in the third person, while really describing the personal contours of a character's thoughts: it was a way of outwitting the imprecise solidity of language.

When the color is how you want it to be, bust out the brush and paint the tea onto the wood. If you added the steel wool, you can also use that as your brush, but I'd recommend putting on gloves first. The stain will absorb pretty quickly and you probably won't need to wipe off any excess. (I didn't.) You can apply more than one coat.

With such finely crafted technical aspects, and a great supporting cast, it's understandable why Soderbergh would take a chance on an unknown property like Carano in the lead. Primarily known as an MMA fighter, Carano really brings it in the fight scenes and though her range is somewhat limited, Soderbergh tailors Haywire to her strengths. She doesn't quite have the charisma of some of her more seasoned co-stars, but she is believable as a special agent/ass-kicking-machine which is fairly rare in the subgenre of the female-centered action picture.

I was drawn to unschooling because it felt like a natural extension of attachment parenting. I felt like we had trusted our children from day one to become the people they needed to be. I also remember that we started this journey knowing that each child would be ready for the challenges of life in their own time and in their own way. Remembering these two things has helped me tremendously.

I do this thing with clothes though, particularly pieces I'm especially fond of. I tend to attach a specific memory to them. Apparently this is not a recent development in my psyche, as my mother will tell you that I'm notorious for saying, whenever she mentions something that occurred years and years ago, "Oh, sure. I remember that day. I remember the outfit I was wearing, actually." This memory association isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course. I still look fondly at the sweater I wore through-out my backpacking days, ten years ago, and doubt I'll ever be able to get rid of the thing. I know which dresses I wore to friend's weddings, I recall certain outfits I wore on important events in my life - big, like job interviews, and small, like meeting a new friend for dinner, hoping we become as good of friends as I imagine we could be. Even when filling up a donation bag for Goodwill recently I had fond memories of the clothes I bid farewell to - the khaki shorts I wore while traveling in Costa Rica, the flannel shirt I'd worn up in Maine with friends, the one I'd accidentally shrunk in the wash once I returned to the city.

Except for that we didnt hang out again for another month and that was basically when I set up a booty call. Hes talked to me once since then, and only when I texted him to ask him for advice for dieting. I was starting to do Muay Thai and MMA and knew that he was a trainer and a chef, so who better to ask? He gave me some pointers and asked what gym I was going to. I told him and that ended the conversation. 2 days later, who do I see at the gym? Yup, hes there. And he pretends that I dont even exist. Awesome. Now I look like a crazy psycho stalker, haha. Luckily, hes only been there twice that Ive been there in the past 3 or so months.

In Libya, riots against those living in the Jewish quarters occurred in Tripoli in January 1945. Sixty percent of Jewish possessions were destroyed and 135 people were killed; soldiers acted as accomplices to the rioters. Jews were forced to evacuate. Jews in Hara, Tripoli, and Benghazi were put on remand. In 1948, there were more riots. An eighty-four-year-old Jewish leader, Halfalla Nahum, was murdered in Tripoli in 1963; during the summer of that year, other Jewish figures were attacked and injured. In 1967, riots broke out and ten people were killed. In 1969, an anti-Semitic campaign was initiated against the Jews, and Jewish cemeteries were razed in 1970. Sixty-four synagogues were destroyed in 1978, and seventy-eight synagogues were transformed into mosques, or, in the case of Benghazi, into Coptic churches.

American Gangster was marketed with the tagline "There are two sides to the American Dream." and it certainly delivers on that promise. The two sides here are both unconventional ones as well, with Washington's Lucas and Crowe's Roberts serving to illuminate each other due to their vast disconnect. If it had been focused entirely on Lucas, this could have been a simple rise and fall of a gangster story, and it certainly does contain those elements, but adding Roberts story enhances it, giving us a bigger view of the world in the film as well as a great counterpoint between them. Both me work in well established systems according to their own terms, but frequently we find that there is little division between their two sides. Robert's fellow cops are as much a part of the drug problem as anyone Lucas works with. While it is based on a true story, I'm only looking at the world presented in the film and the characters as they appear in it. Certainly real world gangsters carrying movies is a long tradition and our awareness of figures like Al Capone, John Dillinger, among others has come from their film portrayals. Like those earlier gangsters, we know that the story isn't over until the gangster takes a fall. One remarkable feature about this film is that those earlier gangsters were public enemy number one, hounded by the FBI, but Frank Lucas' career coming to an end is different, rather than inevitable, it happens against the odds, as the system seemed happy to support him.

While the Municipal Art Society and others have suggested saving the historically valuable Ward Bakery on Pacific Street, the DEIS says its just not possible: Demolition of the former LIRR Stables at 700 Atlantic Avenue and the former Ward Bread Bakery complex at 800 Pacific Street would be significant adverse impacts. The potential reuse of these properties as part of the proposed project has been studied, but it was concluded that there is no feasible or prudent alternative to demolishing them.
We flew out on the Saturday, stayed in a luxurious hotel/apartment, went to the show that night at the Lyric Theatre - the show was fantastic - absolutely loved it and then we spent the morning in Sydney - went to mass at the biggest Cathedral in Australia and then grabbed a bite to eat before we flew home again. I also have to add that Sydney turned on the beautiful weather while we were there too. It was so nice to see the harbour glistening away.

When French colonials moved to Canada at the start of the 18th century they took their Poque with them. It then travelled further south to the New Orleans and spread at first all around Louisiana where it was played in the famous floating saloons and than later all over the country. One of the earliest contemporary mentions of poker happened in J Hildreth book The Dragoon Campaigns to the Rocky Mountains in 1836. The game of the time seemed to be a 20 card deck variation played with Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens which were divided between the players to make the best hand, there were no communal cards.

It was not physical abuse, which I dont condone. It was not even particularly dangerous, though parents who never let their kids out of their sight will argue otherwise. What it was was a dramatic gesture  a wigged out one, indeed  but I could see myself, some day, doing something just about as dramatic. One night I was so mad my tween-age son hadnt taken out the garbage after being asked 18 times (at least) that I said, Im going to scream. And then I did. Bloody murder.

Most do not realise it but the British public had been subject to a campaign of disinformation for a period of almost half a century. We have been lied to, repeatedly and deliberately for a variety of motives, none of which had anything to do with the best interests of you or your country . They lied to hide the fact that they were allowing the largest alien invasion of this country in our Island's history and in order to keep you placidly obedient whilst they changed our country beyond all recognition.

The Sunday-evening after meeting is another rare opportunity for evangelistic service, into which many pastors wisely press their Endeavorers. Dr. Charles M. Sheldon, as has been before stated, advocates making this great young peoples evangelistic service of the week for the actual bringing of men to a decision for Christ, and in his own experience has proved the vast usefulness of such a plan (p.330).
It is by being conformed to the death of Christ, everyday, by the power of His resurrection, that we will gain Christ. What will the outcome of gaining Christ be? What will this special Prize be? It is the out-resurrection from among the dead. You see, everyone will be resurrected. Some will be resurrected to judgement. Some will be resurrected to glory. The out-resurrection, as the Greek states it, is something special for those who have gained Christ. It is for those who have been filled and saturated with His resurrection Life, having died to self. It is a special enjoyment of Christ in His coming 1,000 year reign.

Kirk is a young, rich brat who doesnt think of anyone but himself. To celebrate his twenty-first birthday, Kirk throws a big birthday bash at his fathers huge ranch house. As Kirk celebrates, he takes sexually-enhanced drug the rich enjoy called, Alantica Dream. During the party, Kirks enjoys overindulging in the company of many men, relishing in the pleasure of having orgasm after orgasm from his so-called friends. One moment Kirk is enjoying the party and the next, he wakes up in a cage with a uniquely looking red-headed, freckled man. Since any blemish is considered a flaw, Kirk has never seen such a captivating looking man before and hes immediately intrigued by him. Kirk soon finds out he and the man, Lyndarum, are both to be sold as slaves, and hes both confused and angered by this. To his dismay, the men who captured him do not believe he is THE Kirk Skelling and they treat him like they would any ordinary slave. But there is something about Lyndarums sweet and sexy disposition that Kirk feels an immediate connection with, so he quickly decides to do what he must to keep them both safe. Together. Despite how dire their situation looks, Kirk is determined to get both him and Lyndarum safely away from their captors so they can share a life and love that Kirk never knew he wanted to have until he met Lyndarum. Will they be able to escape captivity and achieve a life and love that both men crave so desperately?

Keely generously invited all of us to her home one evening, for a beautiful dinner party with delicious Mexican food and other homemade treats; and we had the joy of meeting her family and being surrounded by her wonderfully artistic decor. Keely had transformed her living room into an art room, and the results were spirited and beautiful. As soon as we entered her home, we were literally surrounded by her whimsical and colorful works of art, perfectly arranged - almost like being in a Keely Gallery.
I used to think people did these sort of things out of a misdirected desire for connection, maybe that its true for some people and to some extent, but that certainly isnt the only motive. These men dont only pick up lonely women. They are often as successful with women who have boyfriends as with women who are unattached. I doubt all of those women really thought it would be or even wanted it to be more than a one night stand, if theyre really honest with themselves. I think sometimes we allow ourselves to be picked up because it affirms our sexuality and our sex appeal. We also need to feel like that person is worth being wanted by, thus the need for PUAs to come off as a alpha males. There wouldnt be anything affirming about being seduced by a weak or pathetic man.
So what does this mean in your table design? For a square table, 30 inches will give you a small, four person tablelets say a card table or a breakfast nook table. A rectangular table at 30 x 60 will allow six people easily a nice little dining table. A 30 x 90 table (I just usually take it on up to 8 feet) can allow for 10 people.
It was nice having a little break from baking last week, no birthdays (none that I had to make cake for), and no other events, no last-minute thing, nothing. I did enjoy my sleep and not having to wake early to finish some cake or decorating. It wasn't too busy either at work so I could go home on time and play with my baby nephew. I did however, can't stay away for too long from baking. I made this cake last weekend just because for once, I didn't have any particular plan other than errands to do, and this cake has been on my to-try list for a while. So what's special about this cake, other than the fact that it doesn't scream Spring?
So here it is, one day after the last day of CNY, which is rather apt as well since this is my concluding and round-up post for all the festive baking Ive been doing. I know many people do their cookie baking in December, because Europeans and Westerners in general tend to associate cookies with Christmas. For myself however, the cookie mania starts the month before Chinese New Year, whenever that is. This year, Ive actually baked about 20 varieties of cookies, playing around with different recipes. Eventually I think I went back to my kampong bringing 16 types of cookies, most of which had good reviews from my relatives. I still have loads more cookies I want to attempt, but Im shelving them for next year, and who knows, I might come up with even more ideas the next time.

Yesterday I also passed my book onto someone close to me with some of their own health concerns. D was off on a plane trip and I knew this was the perfect read. D was keen on reading more and was really interested in the story. I hoped it would give D the inspiration she needed. I also knew that if I had an ally in the fight against sugar addiction then I would have a fighting chance. Chocolate had always been the one thing I couldnt give up and D was the same. I knew that if we did it together we had half a chance to succeed. D has diabetes type 2 and has tried plenty of other ways to loose weight with fairly minimal success. The next step is medication and that is not something D is interested in. This might be her last chance. D came home today and was pretty captivated in the book herself. D felt that this might be the book that changes her life! Yay for me! Im not alone.

Heres the part I wanted to share: when they got up to leave the whole restaurant began to clap and it got louder and louder. The waitresses and hostess were lined up to wish them well. The two Sushi chefs came out from their work stations and were standing along side of the other workers. They all bowed as the couple walked by. People in the restaurant offered comments out loud, you look gorgeous, have fun, enjoy, drive safe, be careful driving, dance until your feet hurt.the owner of the restaurant thanked them very much for celebrating at their restaurant. Both the boy and the girl were blushing and smiling. Big, huge, happy smiles. They held hands as they walked through the restaurant and out the door. Things quieted down, really quiet after they left. Through the windows you could see them walking towards his dads car. Every one in the restaurant was hoping, HOPING, using esp and HOPING that he opened the door for her

3) Speaking of youth, was Laura Dern seriously THIRTEEN when she made this movie?
Case in point: Dead City Radio, a 1990 release of recordings Burroughs made in the late 80's. Backed by a range of composers and performers including John Cale, Sonic Youth, Lenny Pickett, Donald Fagan and others, the soundscapes here range from jaunty 50's-nuclear-family cheeriness to groaning guitar feedback, all topped off by Burroughs' creaking, raspy monotone. We are treated to all manner of morbid weirdness: Excerpts about the Mugwumps from Naked Lunch, WSB reading from The Bible, pieces from his short story collection Tornado Alley, even a strangely touching piano-and-voice version of him slurring out the old standby "Falling In Love Again".... In German.
This doesnt mean, of course, that The Strong One couldnt come from Labours ranks. Harriet Harman is the most obvious candidate, if only because she has form when it comes to (a) openly saying shed change any law at any time to get a post-dated conviction (b) targeting hate-sectors like bankers and white, older males, and (c) being so clearly bigoted and at least part way round the twist in her gender views. But Hattie herself knows she is unelectable  hence her support for Ed Miliband, as the great hope for becoming a sort of surrogate mother, hatching mad schemes and equality quotients on Harmpersons behalf.
Having sex with him became like the choice between starving to death or eating food you knew was poisoned and would make you wretchedly sick.
BUT! I did complete a piece of wall art that Miss AuBrynne has requested.
When James knocks an elderly lady off her bicycle one night coming home from work, it sets forth the chain of events that shape this novel. One moment will incite in Kate the frustration and unhappiness and urge her to leave. James and Hugh, lifelong friends, had once congratulated themselves on how lucky they were to have found love and happiness with young, beautiful, smart and happy women. Now both of their comfortable, happy lives are in upheaval.
I might never have met you. I might never meet you. But I know that you are wonderful and you don't need to change in any way that doesn't make you happy. You don't need to be anyone but who you are, or dream any dreams but your own. So the next time YOU feel the B*tSh*t Crazy Lady taking you over? Remember that. Preserve and protect the special thing that makes you who you are, no matter what. And be happy.

Every few years an Israeli Jewish politician floats a test balloon. He puts forward the idea that the areas where the Arab citizens of Israel live should be transfered --complete with the citizens-- to the future Palestinian state in exchange for Jewish settlement blocks in the West Bank. Those areas are highly fertile lands in comparison with the alternative option for a territorial swap (an empty zone in the Negev); but to paraphrase Golda Meir, they hate the Arabs more than they love the land.

Paper recycling is old news, but it seems to be an on-and-off venture for most people. Making recycled paper crafts into a business provides fuel to the recycling machine. If you look at bookstore displays, youll find coarse looking stationery and specialty papers. Even if these look old and rough, they are more expensive than those smoother and printed papers. Those coarse specialty papers are handmade and use natural fibers and recycled paper. You dont need to buy a truckload of waste paper to get started. In fact, look around your house. Sort through your old files and see if theres anything in there that you dont need anymore. White office paper like bond papers are great for this recycling project.
Anyone watching ABC's The River? I like it enough to see where it goes for a few weeks. If you missed the first few episodes you can catch up here. If you want the quick version: They're on a boat in the Amazon searching for their lost father/husband/friend who went on some sort of magical quest. So far...monster, bugwalker, creepy doll tree, everyone goes blind(temporarily) and now you're all caught up for Tuesday's episode. I also really enjoy Once Upon A Time and Lost Girl. Grimm on the other hand has completely fallen off my radar.

The Beastie Boys are one of the most important and influential hip-hop groups of all time. They were instrumental in making hip-hop a global, mainstream force. Formed in 1981 as a hardcore band, they combined punk and rap into a singular sound that grew increasingly broad over the years, encompassing a vast array of genres. Yauch, Michael Diamond (Mike D), and Adam Horowitz (Ad-Rock) released several classic albums, including their debut album Licensed to Ill in 1986, 1989's Paul's Boutique, and 1994's Ill Communication.

While Emily played outside, Mr. Whitcombe, their next door neighbour watched her from the window. He felt so sad for Emily and her mother. He knew the pain of loss to, as his wife; Bessie had died only just 1 year ago and left him alone. As he watched Emily and Ellie playing in the snow, he wondered what he could do to help this family?
For Example: If I drew SB.com Favorites from Jar 1 and #55 from Jar two I would look at the project in my Scrapbook.com Favorites and then use my 55th project in there that I had already marked as "Favorite" months ago. Scrap lift it or take some embellishment ideas from it... whatever
Its been a very mixed bag for me photography wise. On one hand for astrophotography I want totally clear skies but for landscape Id prefer a cloudy sky or at least some clouds in the sky. Clouds give you options, slow the exposure down and you can streak the clouds, or if youre lucky enough to get huge high contrast clouds it can give a shot real drama. Clouds also help a sunset along no end; a slightly cloudy sky will always yield a better sunset than a clear sky will.

Like Queen Victoria, Ferdinand did not grow up expecting to rule. He was born in 1863 and trundled along being the eldest son of his archduke father, but nothing else loomed on the horizon until 1899, when Crown Prince Rudolph died in a suicide pact at his hunting lodge at Mayerling. (The photo is of Rudolph, but he and Ferdinand looked a lot alike.)
Visions delivers a diverse, yet distinctive avant-garde album comprised with unmistakable hook-heavy songs that transcend genres. Grimes greets her audience with an astonishing repertoire that its hard to believe the range she possesses. Some songs are perfect for the dance floor while others feel out of this world with a nod to 80s pop music. If you enjoy artists like Lykke Li, Crystal Castles, and the Cocteau Twins, Grimes is a must listen!
Dinner in Broadway Joe's was followed by drinks, more drinks and then possibly a drink or two. Five of us showed the city a good time and finished up in an Irish bar. Where else would you go for a fun night out?

But there are still bands out there that can put together a hell of a good album, and this series, like my old bliss-out posts, is a little celebration of albums, particularly the ones that are well-built... and perhaps it's an elegy for them too, now that the album as artform is becoming less and less relevant in the face of music videos and EPs that can boast a higher hit-song to track-listing ratio (available for 99 cents on iTunes!)

They have compost, squash (SIGH - we winterized everything before the big freeze but forgot to bring the squash stored in the greenhouse inside.....so we have a pile of mushy once frozen squash to feed the chickens....) and I pick a bucket of grass/chickweed for them every day. They love their greens....Today we got 14 eggs from 14 chickens!

When I left local government many new appointments, particularly of senior staff, were being made on short term contracts. For most staff there was no security of employment with cost cutting exercises taking place every year. Services kept suffering as fewer people were there to do the jobs expected by the public. Those that remained spent more and more time gathering statistics for government targets which were becoming harder and harder to achieve in the vicious circle. The rest of the time they were ensuring that there was sufficient paperwork to protect themselves from the culture of blame and litigation sweeping in from the other side of the Atlantic. In short local government had ceased to be a place where all one had to remember was that one had to serve the public and get on with the job of doing that. For many it had become a fight for survival. It had become a place where one's first loyalty was to making sure that one could putting food into the mouths of one's family.
Lemley said that he's seen estimates on the number of suits filed by non-practicing entities that range wildly, from 2% to 50% of all patent litigation. In addition, many struggle even to define what makes a so-called "patent troll" that acquires patents to use in court, and what makes a legitimate non-practicing entity.

In his suit, Mohd Razali Abdullah, 49, claimed that Ooi had slandered him repeatedly and caused defamatory statements to be published by newspapers, websites and news portals in 2009 when he was a municipal councillor, and some of the defamatory words were repeated in newspapers in January 2010.
One of the common motives for farm murders is robbery, and robbery with violence, or the threat of violence, is all too common. For that purpose, farms are seen as a soft target because of their relative isolation. There is time for the robbers to make a getaway.
According to a study involving doctors at Rhode Island Hospital, between May 2009 and November 2010, six patients were admitted to the emergency room there because of wire bristle ingestion. These patients came in complaining of abdominal pain and painful swallowing. They all had just eaten grilled meat. CT scan and x-ray results showed that there were wires in the abdomens and throats of the patients. The doctors determined that these were the grill brush bristles that had come off and gotten stuck in the meat. The studys lead author, radiologist David Grand, says they dont know if this is a widespread problem. He is, however, calling for more research.

Pours dark amber color with heavy lacing. Has a sweet taste with a slightly thick mouth feel. A second glass revealed this to be more malty than hoppy and highly carbonated. Theres a taste of roasted nuts or bread there too with a sweet finish. Hard to find hereabouts and pricey from what I hear, but worth a try for sure.
Scattered. It is the only way to describe my brain of late. I have quite the obessional mind and I would like to start using this for good instead of teenage crushes and buying into someone elses created world. If I am not obsessing over our impending holiday of AWESOME, then it is about the dog that I want. Sometimes I even spend hours looking for exactly the right name for my yet unborn puppy.

This journey of grief in so many ways is a privilege. I feel honored to walk this road and to learn more about my Savior and about my family. I feel blessed to have loved Samuel so much that his absence is deeply painful. And I feel so inexpressibly grateful for Samuel's life. It is among the greatest gifts of my life. And I think this road will be perpetually refining, and for that I am also truly thankful.

I finally staged an intervention for her with all of her kids at my house. All the grown daughters were angry and depressed and everyone cried. They felt crushed and betrayed, and although sympathetic to their mothers plight, they wanted the fighting between their parents to stop. They said it was unbearable for them. After listening to her children, Annie finally grasped that her antics were hurting her relationship with them.
What I Do? This is one of my favorite lines I use, and always spoken with a hard southern Bill Clinton accent, when I ask folks why they are pissed about something I said. I am the type of guy who will ask a question, in response to comments people make. I will respond to comments I here in the grocery line,at work, in a tavern, or at a family Christmas party. Nobody gets a free pass on publicly made comments.

Recently the media has been full of talk about peace and ceasefires. However one group has not given the slightest indication that they are willing to end the vicious campaign which they have been waging for years and which their very existence depends upon. The group in question is of course the Irish rich.

The council could use the current surplus as a temporary measure in order to avoid the cuts for now. This would make the council extremely popular amongst the workers and the community in general. (A far cry from the harsh reality of the feelings towards the council at the moment) The council could then use this popularity to build a mass campaign throughout the county to defend the council against any attack from the Assembly or Westminster and to demand the money necessary for all the jobs and services needed within the area.

In essence, the conservative person is simply one who finds the permanent things more pleasing than Chaos and Old Night. (Yet conservatives know, with Burke, that healthy "change is the means of our preservation.") A people's historic continuity of experience, says the conservative, offers a guide to policy far better than the abstract designs of coffee-house philosophers. But of course there is more to the conservative persuasion than this general attitude."

Director Tim Story mixes it up, keeping all the multiple storylines in play without so much as a hiccup in pacing or narrative. This could have ended up a two-hour commercial for Harveys book, but Story shifts the focus to the individual characters and not the pages of Harveys narrative. Screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman let you see the action from all sides, so this feels like a true ensemble film instead of a man or woman-bashing screed. And as an ensemble piece, its tough to pick out the truly outstanding performances, because the actors do such a wonderful job working with each other. That said, Kevin Hart (Kevin Hart: Seriously Funny) is brilliant as always, and manages to steal just about every scene hes in. His post-divorce bitter manchild is an absolute hoot. And D.C. native Taraji P. Henson brings a softness to her COO that weighs a mans net worth higher than a mans heart. Well, at first anyway.

He couldnt accept this turmoil and failed miserably in next exams and screws his career.

I don't actually believe that, at bottom, writing historical fiction is any different from writing any other kind of fiction: characterisation, structure, prose, plot, process... We're writing for readers now, and so all those things must work for witers and readers Now. But the usual challenges come in different proportions, because of the fundamental definition of historical fiction - at least that of Margaret Atwood, which is the only definition which is useful for a writer.: "fiction set in a time before the writer came to consciousness."

These pictures were taken over a month ago, when the daffodils in the forest behind out house were blooming. That weve got huge clumps of daffodils randomly placed in the forest, and (until I planted some last summer) none in the yard is a mystery. Did the previous owners of our house plant them there? Did they just naturally grow there? Will I kill them if I replant them in the yard so that I can watch them bloom? So many questions.

My dilemma now is whether to finish writing this official resignation letter to be forwarded to his direct boss and corporate headquarters detailing ALL of the straws that broke this particular camel's back, and slap him in the face with it, which is guaranteed to cause a scene, or simply go in, verbally give my two week's notice, citing the note posting and other reasons, in private, minimizing hullabaloo and sending my letter to corporate detailing what I feel to be his failures as a manager quietly.

Add to the mix that I am naturally a very shy and introverted girl you have a total social misfit, lol. So, I really do not know if I will ever make friends around this area. Other people seem to communicate so easily and I always just feel like an awkward spectator, not ever really connecting with anyone. The whole thing just makes me so frustrated, if my baby were not with me I doubt if anyone would say one word to me (or me to them.)

To make sure that the audience really gets it, you should incorporate the Rule of Three while revealing your characters money-hungry nature. For example, if shes a pick pocket, maybe she gets away with it twice, and gets caught the third time. Shes unapologetic when caught, the song changes, and then she continues to reveal her obsession with money throughout the act.
I have felt so unsettled this year. I started off the year with the seed of a possibility of moving, which grew and grew, and we readied our home for sale by painting and boxing up belongings. Then we moved and have been in temporary housing since July. I feel dislodged, without a nest to feather. My home is not my refuge. I would like to get into my new house (looks like we'll close mid February!) and make it my home. I also only did one show in 2010, and the lack of that creative outlet has been really difficult. I hope to have more theatre in my life in 2011. I also want more confidence. I feel shaken after this move... unsure and unsettled and without not only a home, but a PLACE... and my confidence has plummeted.

After Macys I talked to Patrick about the vests and the suits. The sale was just for the jacket and pants and it wasnt very good. It would have been $220 then the vest was $75 and we would still need the shirt and tie, which would probably be another $50. We just could not ask the guys to spend $350 on a suit for a wedding  and that is before tax!
And the women always look amazing, straight from the beauty parlor. I assume straight from the salon, since that is what I would do if I only got my hair done once a week.

The number of people in the 50-60% range, the reasonably well-off low-income people, has remained stable in the range of 4 to 4.8 million between 1979 and 2009. The 40-50%, not particularly well-off low-income people, have had more of a rocky ride and are up from 2 million in 1979 to 3.5 million in 2009. But the poor sods on 40% or less have rocketed from 1.3 million to 5.9 million (up from 2.4% of the population to 9.8%).

As he peeled yet another leech off of his arm, the general cursed the ancestors of the Americans that he and his troops were chasing deeper and deeper into the swamp. Then he cursed all Americans as well as their free country. Where were the riches that he had been promised? Where were the assets to be recovered for Weis own homeland. How would these backwater savages ever repay their debt?

Of all the broad religious traditions, I think Buddhism comes closest to retaining the spirit of its founder and greatest teacher, Gautama the Buddha. Buddhists have never started a war to advance their cause. No one has ever been forced to convert to Buddhism.
The public have had to swallow so many of the governments half-baked ideas, theyre starting to realise this coalition has got its fingers in so many pies that once their fat cat friends have finished gobbling everything up, all thats going to be left for the rest of us are just a few crumbs.

How can I as a parent not do everything to help make this opportunity happen for my child? I wish I could go!! Of course to help celebrate this event, I have been researching some recipes for Kenyan foods! The one we decided to try first is for a very simple flat bread called Chapati that we found on the internet here. There some other recipes on this page that we hope to try out over the next few months before the Boy leaves on his trip.

Though it pains us, the forced plastic party of Xmas
In my opinion, some of the most memorable and defining moments in D&D come as a result of those split-second decisions that players must make about how far to risk their characters' life and limbs. You know what I'm talking about. Your party is being decimated by a pack of ghouls. Grumple the dwarf has been cut off from the rest of the party, trapped in a room with four ghouls closing in for the kill. He's wounded and will surely die if left to his own devices. Meanwhile, the other three grieviously wounded party members have an escape route - 50' of open hall in front of them - beckoning...
So fuck you, weird, hairless, bipedal mammal. This shit is on you now.
My worry is that once the Likudniks begin to realize Obama may not be defeated by the GOP at home, the current Israeli government would launch a war without warning to create a crisis to humiliate the president, rally end-times evangelicals to vote, send oil prices soaring, and force the US president to coopt a war he does not want and does not yet believe is necessary. If that helps the GOP nominee, so much the better. Every GOP candidate is now committed to the most extreme positions of the Likudnik Israeli right - and are to the bellicose right of most Israelis.
I love how it turned out! Even though it looks like there is a lot going on, it really is a simple card.
P.P.P.S. I swear that one month Ill write twenty posts and fill up a whole category of 20 Dear Whoevers.

Somehow, with all the excitement of the unified patent court and the unitary patent system for Europe buzzing round his ears, this member of The SPC Blog team quite forgot that Case C518/10, Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd, Aventis Holdings Inc v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, a reference for a preliminary ruling from the Court of Appeal (England and Wales), was still in the pipeline. This case has sped through the judicial corridors of Luxembourg, arriving in November 2010 and departing -- in the form of an Order -- on 25 November which was handed down this morning.
Jenny Tonge has never said anything hostile to the Jewish community in Britain. Only a liar like Bright (or an anti-Semite  since Bright is not Jewish it is highly likely that his support for Zionism is, as was the case with most non-Jewish Zionists, motivated by anti-Semitism) could confuse British Jews for Zionism and Israeli Jews .
15. Reviewing these books, we can now see that Banks set aside the notion of operating under the Charters they hold as banks, instead of being Banks they became like very poor casino operators and traders, selling what they do not own. The records in our possession, signed and registered by the receiving and managing commercial bank, show the underlying funds in numbers and amounts that stagger the imagination. The Green Hilton and Garuda Memorial Agreements demonstrate clearly the value of the global account system.
But the number one reason Zumba is great besides all of that is because anyone can do it. Elderly women, small women, large women, some men, some large men, children.

Ah, who couldn't love F.Scott.Fitzgerald's favourite drink? Apparently F.Scott loved gin because he thought it undetectable on the breath, which it isn't, of course.

Claudia is understanding more, I know she doesn't understand on the grand scheme level, but she knows enough to talk about Curtis and that does help. Today we were at a tea party My Other Blog and were at a table with a few grandmas and their granddaughters. One asked another little girl how many brothers she had. The grandmother said something about her having a brother who died and they are trying to "encourage" her to be aware of him and making sure to mention him.
First, in Johns Gospel, Jesus uses the title woman to politely address other women with whom he has a positive relationship. This is seen, for example, when Jesus tenderly appears to Mary Magdalene on Easter Sunday (Jn. 20:15), when He forgives the sins of the woman who committed adultery (Jn. 8:10), and when He draws the Samaritan woman to faith in the Messiah (Jn. 4:21). Given the positive way this address appears in Johns Gospel, Jesus calling Mary woman would not indicate a rebuke or lack of affection.

In 2010 the Australian Government introduced a series of reforms to improve access and choice in maternity services for women in Australia. The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) is now seeking feedback from women on what their experiences have been with recent maternity service arrangements and whether they are aware of the reforms that are in place. Your important feedback will help to shape the future of maternity services in Australia.

I recently attended Secret Church: The Cross and Suffering at The Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham, Alabama. I cannot even begin to unpack all that I learned and that I am continuing to learn from my time there. Suffice it to say, David Platt could be a professional auctioneer and we covered 220-something pages and 75 key texts in 1 night. Now, we all know that I am a Nerd (yes, thats nerd with a capital N), but whoa Nelly! my mind was so moving so fast that night that I think a little bit of it is still spinning trying to comprehend everything that I learned. Perhaps that is why I took no less than 4 trips to the main office building today at work in 20 minutes because I kept forgetting something. Yes, that sounds like a good excuse.

In between the women, Byron did manage some verses  Beppo, the first part of Don Juan and a part of the tragedy Marin Faliero.

As the clubs played, Bandit's wife, a former player herself, was gracious enough to talk Capitals Base Ball with me. Wickets of the Gothams, already informed me a former member of the Gothams moved to Ohio and founded the Capitals Base Ball Club back in 1998. Bandit's better half confirmed that and expanded the story for me. It was a gentleman named Charlie who moved to Ohio and founded the team. He went by the nickname of LEFTY, but has since retired from the game. He now devotes his time to the company he started out of his garage. For Lefty also happens to be the founder of the Phoenix Bats Company, hailing out of Plain City, Ohio.

So what is the project? Solar-powered and lit from within, with a DVD player and monitors, it tries to rethink the hospital waiting room; in fact, the cartoon-like, festive structure with a kind of external tattoo of abstract graphics, is "sited at Policlinico Umberto 1, Rome's largest public hospital, and one that has been recently controversial because of scandals of unsafe and unsanitary conditions."As an "enlightenment" era hospital, it was planned in a decentralized way, with specialities (pediatrics, respiratory maladies, contagious diseases) distributed throughout the campus, with no single central space. The project attempts to create a centralized space for all kinds of waiting (waiting for an appointment, to be picked up, the diagnosis of a loved one, for treatment, convalescing to recover).As Inaba himself explained in a recent issue of Art Review, the real purpose was to create an environment to cope with our restlessness, if not through easing the irritation of having to wait, then at least through distraction from it."

Communication remains the key to everything we do, and so we have been careful to cover all the bases to keep you informed. We have asked the Galactic Federation to make itself fully known to you after disclosure is announced, and have asked the Agarthans to do likewise. Each of you needs to acquire full knowledge of what is happening and why, and where it is all headed. It is equally important for us to have feedback from you regarding this sudden flurry of events to hit your societies. We, the Ascended Masters, intend to appear and heal and bless all of you even before the mass landings. We sincerely ask for your feelings on these matters as the time has come to change how you interact with Heaven. You are each a sacred physical angel. You need to learn about your divine lineage and the sacred Orders you are a part of. Ponder on these matters, as Heaven is now returning in force to your world!

Whats even more troubling is that in Nigeria, the country that has arguably suffered most from oil drilling, oil accidentslarge and smalloccur almost weekly, and we hear little about it. A lethal combination of sloppiness, corruption, weak regulation, and lack of accountability has meant that each year since the 1960s, there has been a spill the size of the Exxon Valdezs into the Niger Delta. Large purple slicks cover once fertile fields, and rivers are clogged with oil leaked decades ago. It has been called the black tide: a stain of thick, gooey oil that has oozed over vast tracts of land and poisoned the air for millions of Africans. In some areas fish and birds have disappeared: the swamps are silent.

James and Mary took off toward James house to help Marlene in the delivery of their fourteenth child. Mary loved being a grandmother. She took pride in telling everyone what a wonderful mess of grand kids she had. Howie started back down that ladder. This is when the heavy bags shifted and came crashing down on top of Howie knocking him off the ladder, pinning him to the floor. With no one knowing he was in trouble, Howie laid there, praying for someone to find him. He died that evening from internal bleeding. The injuries which took his life couldnt have been repaired, even if he had been found. This was a time when advanced medicine wasnt much more than a stethoscope and a tongue depresser. It wasnt until the following day, when he didnt show up for supper, that his body was found, by his father. Everyone attended the funeral and Summer was literally beside herself. She married and widowed twice, before she turned fifteen was as devastating as it could be to such a young woman. Both of her husbands died in terrible accidents and this caused folks to start calling Summer the black widow. This only added salt to her wounds of loss.

Rock: Just before reaching the Church Street end, you will encounter two ravines that converge near the trail on the left. The boulders are so plentiful that they resemble the ramparts of a fortress. You may find it hard to resist scrambling up them. If you decide to make the short climb, check out the view from the rocky outcrop nearest the trail and next to a small stream for a fine view of the forest floor and the lake beyond.

While their focus sometimes slips a little, Vedaki creates something exotic, surprising and so seamlessly organic it sounds derived from an ancient tradition all its own; from some land where their Russian, Indian and West African ancestors forged a common musical language centuries ago.

When we are at zero, we have to start somewhere, and perhaps the sanest, best, and surest place to start is with the eye of the beholder. We are in a certain place at a certain time and we feel a certain way about it. Lets start here. That means put the pen to the page and write about the exact moment and place where you find yourself. Take an inventory of what surrounds you and what you feel about that. This is a starting-off place.
There is nothing About Sharktopus that displeases me. From the wonderfully joyous title theme music to the man, the icon Eric Roberts, from the early morning drinking, sea faring radio DJ (who became my new hero) and his bikini clad assistant to the folk dancing, fire brandishing display team. It was a joy from start to finish. But most importantly its about a ruddy shark/octopus hybrid for flips sake, I really dont need to say anything more than that.

Her idea of bloggers and real people having an innate populist talent for creating well designed and beautifully decorated spaces jibed with my own feelings. She also included personal back stories about each home she chose to photograph and write about, and this makes the book have depth. And that she traveled to each location, and each home, and got to know each space, each town or city, and each home owner, this certainly adds another layer of personality and richness."
Finally, he arrived, changed out some rusted pieces and recharged my unit with coolant. And then he put freon in the air conditioner--hiyo! Anyway, the air was running fine for a while.

Anna was sympathetic and as helpful as she could be, but since the jurisdiction over my child support and custody issues lies out-of-state, there were limits to what she could do and say. Nonetheless, after the mystifying confrontation I had in court with a Legal Aid lawyer bearing a clipboard with Annas name on it, I had to renew contact to find out what the hell was going on. That council landlords are supposed to go to was worthless for advice of any kind, and Judge Crime obviously didnt owe me an explanation.
In this piece (not a great pic I realize) I have hidden symbols and images alluding to the struggle that is involved in finding ones center (including the four directions). I suppose its a bit feminine in nature, but I almost called it finding the warriors center because I did feel a bit like a warrior trying to fight my way to freedom from all my worries. The center is calm, but finding it is not easy. To all my creative comrades soldier on!
These little nuggets of offal have flavor that reminds me of veal but texture more smooth like organ meat - fried to a beautiful golden brown here to better highlight both.

The interesting thing about the protest is that it is not instigated or organized by any political parties. It is an organic and spontaneous protest by the people from all walks of life, young and old, men and women and children,Muslims and Christians alike.

I started on this post a few weeks back and then realized I should hang onto the thought until the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, which is today! The daylight hours here in Paris have become incredibly long: today the sun rises at 5:47 am and won't set until 9:58 pm. Compare this with back home in DC where the sun rises at roughly the same time but sinks below the horizon a full hour and a half earlier.
Ralegh at once followed his unlucky forerunners.

After an amazing first night out with our international friends in the Berlin nightlife, we started the next day a bit delayed. We saw many well-known landmarks and impressive buildings in the following days but one highlight were doubtless a few of the famous historical sight-seeing places.
Despite the fact that probably my all-time favorite childrens book is The Very Hungry Caterpillar, I despise the way caterpillars bodies slink. Nevermind that they usually turn into delicate butterflies, which I love. I mean, nevermind that theyre the same darn creature in either form. It doesnt matter. With their many pairs of legs fanning their long bodies out like a wave as they clamber across the sidewalk and up the trees, I cant help but get the willies.

In much the same way as sailors personify the sea Heaney treats nature as a living entity, not just a variety of living things something that might clutch him and drag him under. Perhaps this is where his fascination developed around 1970 for the Iron Age bodies that had been found in bogs throughout Ireland and Denmark.[10] As much as Heaney could be described a nature poet what strikes me here in this collection is Heaneys fear of nature and the ways in which the commonplace can become threatening or evil. This is exactly what I got from Mr. Bleaney in which the ordinary and everyday becomes menacing. I have to wonder just what Heaneys experiences of nature were growing up. As the eldest child it must have been anticipated that Seamus might follow in his father's footsteps and yet he chose to reject that lifestyle. This is probably evidenced in the first poem of the collection, Digging in which he sits in his room writing whilst his father digs outside:
As it is across generations, might it be across the individuals that make up the generational branches of a family tree?

A sister mentioned how she was in need of prayer. Great she wanted help, and she asked for it. The Holy Spirit immediately brought to mind a scripture. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. James 5:16a,b (KJV) We should pray for, help and lift up one another. Be determined to no longer have your hand in the pot only to take, but also to add something of value. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in fullpressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back. Luke 6:38 (NLT)
So then I go on. the road is good and the edge is marked with a white strip. This was really good because the headlights form the oncoming vehicles can be blinding, so I would focus my headlamp on the white strip and ride when they came. The trucks would sometimes even give me a dipper, lower their lights for an instant and that really helped. The climb was tiring, but Id been expecting it so it was ok. That way the altitudinal profile was very helpful. Soon it started becoming light and I found myself riding a smooth, broadly undulating road. I passed Ayanur in this early morning light before the sun was up and stopped in my tracks as I spotted a large owl sitting on a peepal right above the middle of the road. I could barely make out its silhouette and it flew away as I looked up and saw its eye-shine. There were nice forest patches between the villages now and I passed by some patches that looked like erstwhile teak plantations.

I had tried an Ergo early last summer, but ended up selling it to a friend. So many of my friends had raved about them, but I never seemed to be able to get it to fit comfortably. It was hard for me to buckle the top clasp when I was wearing my little one on the front, and I always ended up with intense pain along my spine and between my shoulder blades when I wore it. And by the time I tried the Ergo, I had so much practice tying a baby wrap that it was actually faster for me to put on a wrap than the Ergo!

I like this place. It is very tranquil. In the middle of the place, among the retail shops lie a Japanese garden. Lots of fish in the water. The cable car station is located in this area. The view at the platform on top is terrific! It is also quite shaky and windy.
Im having severe pain from plantar fasciitis and a subsequent cortisone shot in my heel. Since I can hardly walk, Im stuck in bed or on the couch feeling lame. To make the best of it, I set up my computer in the living room and pillows to prop my leg up, and then I used my awkward positioning to help me stretch throughout the day. Injuries can be a real setback when youre trying to lose weight because your physical activity is limited. But movement of any kind is better than no movement at all, and stretching is the easiest way to maintain mobility. It also just feels good.

So why dont I just leave my husband you might be asking? I stay because of my children. I stay because they are so normal and smart and well adjusted. I dont want to do anything to hurt that. I would rather stay in a dead relationship than risk changing them. I am trying to live my life right now emotionally invested in their day to day activities. If you were to be in my house while they are here you would think we are the perfect family and in many ways we are. My lover is a secret side of me..not them.

Kaufman says some banks are so big that their failure could trigger a chain reaction in the financial system. The cost of borrowing for so-called too-big-to-fail banks is lower than that of smaller firms because lenders believe the government wont let them go under. The perceived safety net creates what economists call moral hazard -- the belief that bankers will take greater risks because theyll enjoy any profits while shifting losses to taxpayers.

First of all, one must be a visualist. That isnt a real word, but it describes what I mean. A person who is stunned by physical natural beauty (certainly not at the exclusion of aural, tactile, or emotional stimuli) possesses visual aqueducts to the world through his or her eyes. Infinitesimal flashes of stunning images move him beyond belief. These impressions are captured in his minds eye, never to be lost, forever to be savored. And often, when this type of writer is creating, they see the movie in their mind, pressing from within, allowing readers to feel intimate and involved in a scene.

The article then recommends other useful articles on various iPad functions, such as Page Flips Are Better Than Infinite Scroll, which lays out the pros and cons of both, but then argues that ultimately the page flip, when kept simple, is better than infinite scroll because it helps one keep their place when reading whereas the infinite scroll one can accidentally lose lose their place.
10. Along the Delaware River, from Washington Crossing State Park on PA Rt. 32/Rt. 611 to Easton, PA. It's great to do this scenic and historic drive on a foliage-lit fall afternoon, have dinner and a couple excellent beers in Easton, and then return at night with a full moon reflecting off the river. Beautiful.

Like most everything else in my home . . . this one has great memories attached to it as well. You see, I was in England, Wales, and Scotland in the Spring of 2002 for a month-long vacation. It was one of those trips where I just began dog-earring pages in all my favourite travel books . . . and then figured out a route that would take me to each of them. London. Glouster. Chester. York. Edinburgh. Aberdeen. Inverness. And so on. But, the day I was supposed to leave York and head north to Scotland, there had been an over-night storm that had closed most of the train service - and one could only travel in case of emergencies. (well, my emergency was that a small antique store in Edinburgh had this tea service on hold for me - I had been speaking with them via phone for months) So, I kinda fibbed a little. And boarded a bus from York going north. Needless to say . . . this little tea service has served me well for many years. I bough several pieces that day - so don't fret - I still have plenty of reminders of that trip at the house.
How do you save a drowning person? Lifeguards experience this when someone is floundering in the water. Sometimes they wait, observing the victim and when all strength is gone, and they are unable to fight back, they jump in to the rescue. At such a stage the drowning person gives up and the rescuer takes over.

An improvement on the chain rakes is the so-called porcupine machinery, which has, perhaps, been more extensively adopted than any other form of mashing apparatus. Of an example of this form of mashing machine we gave an engraving on page 532 of our number for the 29th of May last, our illustration representing a vertical section and plan of one of the cast-iron mash-tuns at Messrs. Trumans brewery, which mash-tuns we may mention, are all, with one exception, also fitted with Steels masher, which we shall describe presently. The mashing apparatus of which we are now speaking, consists, as will be seen, of a series of rakes carried by curved arms fixed to a pair of horizontal shafts placed one above the other; the rakes being arranged so that, as the shafts revolve, they pass each other and thoroughly turn over the goods in the mash-tun. The inner ends of the horizontal shafts are carried by plummer blocks attached to brackets which encircle the central vertical, or driving, shaft, the lower end of which latter shaft rests upon a suitable bearing at the bottom of the mash-tun. The outer ends of the rake shafts rest in bearings carried by a kind of frame, which is connected by tie bars with the brackets encircling the central shaft, and which is supported by a pair of rollers which bear on the rim of the mash-tun. The upper part of this frame also carries bearings for a pair of shafts, which are geared together, and each of which has, running loose on it, a pinion which gears into a rack formed round the edge of the mash-tun. Each shaft, also, carries a sliding clutch for connectiug it to its pinion, and these clutches are both worked by one lever, arranged as shown in the plan, so that either can be thrown in gear at pleasure, but so that they cannot be engaged simultaneously. One of the pinion shafts extends inwards towards the centre of the mash-tun, and at its inner end it carries a bevel wheel, which gears into a bevel pinion on the central shaft, this pinion being about one-third the size of the wheel. The rake shafts also carry bevel wheels, which gear into equal sized wheels on the vertical shaft, the pairs of wheels being arranged so that the two rake shafts are both made to revolve in the same direction.

Alas, I couldn't find an image of a bottle of Marmite ANYWHERE, so, completely BY RANDOM, I found this action-packed image by one of my favourite comic heroes, Frank Miller. I've NO IDEA what it is about, but I'm sure it's an intelligent, thoughtful and non-bigotted and even-handed debate about the so-called 'clash of civilization' we've been hearing so much about since, oh, September 2001.

She also told me she peeled off one of her stomach bandages, a large patch b/c she'd experienced post-surgical bleeding. In a subsequent call, I tried to tell her that she's being crazy for attention, but she would not let me speak.
It's easy to understand why.

These energized sun particles have a combined force equal in some cases to a CME. They can cause magnetic storms of such magnitude that they overload power lines with excess current, and cause widespread blackouts. One of these events happened in September 1859 when a solar flare lasted nearly a week. Most of Middle America was without power for that period. It is remembered in astronomical and meteorological circles as the Superstorm or the Carrington Event.

On an unassuming block of the 9th arrondissement in Paris, obscured by thick curtains over the windows and door, Le Chateaubriand could easily go unnoticed, if not for the crowd gathered around outside from about 8-12 each evening. The curtains tell you, we dont care if you come in or not, in that nonchalant bobo fashion that only Paris pulls off so well.

'A milestone'
Another classic early 70s album from Marcos Valle, But, this album took a little while to grow on me. Perhaps because, when I'm obsessively-compulsively collecting, consuming, and divulging music, I am busy worshiping the Dark One, Satanis, Beelzebub, Lucifer, or Jimmy Witherspoon - I am a little put off by the opening track on this one, 'Jesus Meu Rei.' On the other hand, there is an apocryphal and even millenarian streak to a lot of the content on this album. Satan may have granted me the power to acquire gluttunous amounts of music over the years, but far be if from me to question The Brothers Valle if their faith is strong. It's a gorgeous baroque pop tune with whispy harpsichord and strummy acoustic guitar and very, um, "churchy" organ from none other than Dom Salvador. Then tuning into the lyrics and I am surprised, in spite of knowing that I shouldn't be, of Paulo Srgios genius. In its hymnal piety the song also calls on Jesus to look around at how the world has changed, and ambiguous lines that can either be a lament of world gone down the wrong path, or perhaps a plea to some type of moral relativity adn realism ("nada e ninguem / sabe o que  mal / e o que  bem / Jesus meu rei / fazendo lei / Passa seu tempo real"). A chorus of voices that's built since the first verse swells into the transcendent bridge and the softly provocative lines:
"I start my new job tomorrow."
Id say that you might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true. But you might not have heard that I became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people. You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons. And Id tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson. And after 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery!
The only complaint I have is small, and that is the quality of the poems printing  theyre a bit blurry. However interesting issues arise here concerning reproduction, distribution, and the existence of the image; and thus the poem/book: where/what is the original? And if this lurks somewhere on a computer, as an intangible sequence of ones and zeroes  what, then, are the implications?

So I went off in search of something else to do, thinking that the line would go down some and I might do it later.

Life is too short to be spent in judgment of others.
A few days later my whole world went colorless. I couldn't figure out what the hell happened. I was walking along my merry way and then all of the sudden, I couldn't see colors anymore. I was sad, missed my mom, and was a permanent fixture on the couch. Once Dirty said this all started because Hanks and I couldn't be friends anymore, I got defensive. There was NO way I'm THIS sad because a friend of mine who isn't THAT important in my life said we can't hang anymore! "What kind of person does that make me?" I seriously questioned EVERYTHING! I questioned my marriage, my feelings for Dirty, my feelings for Hanks, my mom's death, myself, everything! I wondered if I had some serious feelings for Hanks that I didn't know about. It wasn't easy but I told all of this to Dirty. I felt if something was going on with me, he had to know. This is our future! He took it well, probably because I was so pathetic and crying and knew exactly what was going on. He let me spill my guts and then told me, that and Hanks "breaking up" was just a trigger. "You two are friends, you guys text and hang out, it's a loss, even if it's a small one. But this is triggering the feelings of your mom's death." Well hell! I didn't even think about it that way and why would I? My mind was just blank and I felt so dead inside.
Breakfast would be waiting and it would be eaten under the watchful eyes of one of the aunts.

The most profound usage of the olive tree in the Bible, however, is in relation to the Lords plan of redemption, and the Church. Romans 11:17-21 17 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. You will say then, Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in. Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.

Part of Catherines award is a bursary of $10,000 which she is using to run Influential Women forums with her partner Elizabeth Brennan to build capacity and confidence in rural women to empower them to engage and build consumer/producer relationships. Catherine is committed to encouraging rural women to celebrate the roles that they play in agriculture, communicate more effectively with the consumer and each other and collaborate between industries to speak and act with a united voice. She is hoping the forums will also act as a conduit into other leadership programs.
This time around on first taste the flavor was the familiar profile, bready and creamy smooth, but the finish seemed surprisingly bitter, not hops bitter, just bitter. As I progressed with my glass the bitterness remained and even arrived a little earlier in the profile. It was a much different beer then I had last time. I suspect the problem was my lunch which I had a couple of hours earlier, pork chops with a mango-tomato salsa. Im thinking the beer picked up the acid left from the fruit and had an adverse reaction to it. Dont get me wrong, even this way Triple XB wasnt bad, but it wasnt the same, so time to track down a third bottle.
Your voice matters. They say that actions speak louder than words, but words can inspire if they are based on actions. Put the two together, your actions and your words and they will add value to each other. If people are watching your actions and hearing your words, they will begin to do the things you do. This will have a multiplying effect over time. Why bother, because your voice matters when it is coupled with actions that are based on your involvement. If you were not born a millionaire or born into royalty; you will have to build it from the ground up. How much you get done depends on how much of a team you have around you. I used to like to watch that T.V. show where they could tear down and rebuild a house in a week. Cant do that by yourself, you need a team; and your team needs to see that you are willing to back your words with your actions.

This is the last thing that I would like to discuss. Firstly the name  are they transfers or Proof of Payment (POP). Depending on where you are, or what you are doing they can be either. My feeling is that they should be called POP. Because that is what they are. And it should be expected that all passengers be required to have a POP (not unlike the GO transit system in and around the GTA). It can be used to transfer from one vehicle to another  but its main purpose is to show that you paid to be on the system.

Sng So aka Grass Jelly is a dessert/drink popular throughout Southeast Asia. According to Chinese medicine it has "cooling" properties and is good for the skin.

Thus, jelly made from cooling grass is....you guessed it Grass Jelly.

Today, in part of our discussions I talked about the fact that we need to know who we are in Christ and operate according to the royalty we are. We have the full authority and power of Jesus. I mentioned that it even says that those who are followers of Christ will be able to do everything and even more than Jesus had done (John 14:12). So then, to make it practical I asked, How many of you have prayed for the sick and seen them get well. A few raised their hands. Great, I responded, that means you are walking in royalty. You are doing what Jesus did. So then I ventured further in my questioning, expecting a negative reply, and said, How many of you have raised the dead?

These intimate personal conversations with Rufus own family in these two songs should not leave the impression that there is a dominant heavy and gloomy sound to the album. Yes, that sound is definitely to tumble on and there is a melancholic tune to some of the songs. However, it is a moving collection of many unexpected pieces that are successfully combined into one consistent albumAn album that turns into a musical open buffet, worthwhile to listen to at least to hear how Rufus would meet the sound of an earlier epoch.
He has a problem with the idea that the state doesnt have rights to limit individuals wants and passions. Notice he doesnt say the state has a right to limit how you act on your wants and passions (which it does if said wants and passions hurt another person)but he actually said the state can legislate your wants and passions. Your thoughts and feelings. What you usually think of when you hear the terms Thought Crimes or Big Brother are nothing compared to what Santorum wants. Not even entitled to the sanctity of your own mind. Nope, the government can legislate that too.

During the summer, it just doesn't seem this way. Everyone is happy, the house stays clean, and it takes less time to get things done! In the winter it takes so much more effort! Maybe because in the winter the only way things feel relaxing is sitting in a candle lit clean house, with a hot cup of tea watching a movie or reading a book. In the winter everyone plays inside all day long, and that relaxing setting is non-existent some days!
Its fitting, then, that the other major news story of the day was the handing down of several suspensions to the players that were involved in the Saints Bountygate scandal. (Johnathan Vilma  full season, Anthony Hargrove  eight game, Will Smith  four games, Scott Fujita  three games.)
Anticipation seems to be a universal of all living things. Cats wait outside the mouse-hole, squirrels bury nuts for the winter, birds build nests for the expected new arrivals. We humans with our expanded mental abilities quite possibly are capable of more anticipation than any other living organism. As children we count the almost-infinite number of days to Christmas, or the interminable hours spent in the back seat of the car until were finally there.
I did by changing the flour, adding in some DABP, butter , and yeast, took out the egg white And now.. voila, a total change!!!! Absolutely yummy.
As I mentioned in America's Failed Russian Putsch , the American actions are acts of war, blatant acts of war. If it came to light that Russia, China or Germany had flooded one or another of the US parties with foreign cash, the scandal would never quiet down and that same Jabbering fool McCain would be singing "Bomb, bomb (fill in nation's name)".
I dont know the context in which the music is used I never finished watching season one and I may have seen the relevant episode already, but I cant remember. It was about seven years ago now when it first aired. That being said, I like to imagine Commander Adama is giving his son Apollo a gift  a good lighter.
The Barnes & Noble reader is just told that this book is for ages 12 and up according to CommonSenseMedia. (For the record? I've given it to my 9 year old niece, who will read it if and when she gets through all the Warrior books). If the parent clicks "more" they will get the reasons for the 12 plus rating. Barnes & Noble gives the publisher age range (ironically, ages 9 to 12, which I agree with). If the parent reads to Editorial Reviews (but why should they, when they aren't highlighted as CommonSenseMedia does?), they get a variety of ages: ten and up from Publishers Weekly; grades 5 to 8 from School Library Journal; ages ten to fourteen from Kirkus.
Let me first dispel a common misconception about world building and writing speculative fiction. You have to do research! Yes, the world that you are creating is yours, and yes the rules are different from those of the normal world. However, any speculative fiction world must be close enough to the real world to engender familiarity. If you dont do any research, and you wind up putting jungle plants in the desert, or ignoring the fact that humans cant breath in a vacuum, then your readers will notice. Even minor things, like forgetting that sound doesnt travel in space (and thus you cant hear explosions), or forgetting that eagles ride rising thermal air instead of flapping their wings to stay a loft, will be noticed. In fact, often times small mistakes are harder to dismiss than big ones. For instance, if I write a story in which humans can breath in space (as ridiculous as it is), a reader is much more likely to accept this and keep reading than that same reader is to accept a single mention of an eagle flapping its way through the sky. Huge changes are expected in speculative fiction (i.e. magic, spaceships, laser pistols, elves, dwarfs, etc), and so a huge but consistent change is fairly easy to swallow, it is within the readers grasp. However, a mistake from lack of research (i.e a single mention of a broad-leafed plant in the desert or a man in 1975 with a cell phone) will set your readers eyes to rolling and thats when they stop caring. Be creative, and be bold, but do your research and dont be stupid. If you want to make a people group that trains falcons to deliver messages, thats fine, but if everyone uses pigeons except for the one random person who has a falcon that you somehow forgot to mention before, that people will notice.
It's hard to believe that we have two children now. But, at the same time, it seems completely natural. I know things will get easier once Connor is on a normal schedule and I can get some sleep in the evenings.
Sorry excuse for a man, Beck thought with contempt as the two remaining straws were held up for his choosing. Without looking away from his fidgeting engineer, Damien lowered the pistol and drew a straw.

The mildness of Proseccos combined with their lower alcohol level also make them a good ingredient for punches and cocktails. In fact, Prosecco is known throughout the world as an ingredient in the legendary Bellini, a peach and Prosecco cocktail that was created in the 1930s at the famous Harry's Bar in Venice. The original cocktail is made with one part white peach pure and two parts Prosecco.

-- An Editorial: Teacher convention con. This time each year virtually every school in New Jersey shuts down for at least two days so a fraction of the state's 176,735 public school teachers can go to Atlantic City for the annual New Jersey Education Association convention.

Shellfish entrees are better, notably day boat scallops that let all their sweetness come through -- although supporting it with chorizo and butter provides an odd base for such a delicate crustacean. Best is a lobster tail, which is not only vivid and lightly butter-poached, but has some more support; you might find yourself sneaking other fish onto this plate.

This does not mean standards have to be dumbed down, to use an offensive term that often implies black and Hispanic students are inherently less able to learn. Rather, the guidelines encourage mentoring and tutoring programs, links between universities and racially isolated school districts, and other approaches that could eventually funnel more such students into college and then the workforce.

1. The first step is to make garlic chile paste, the ingredient that gives the soup its robust flavor. The paste, called nam prig pao, is made by dicing 4 large garlic cloves and thinly slicing 1/4 of a red onion. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil on high heat in a saute pan. When hot, add garlic, onion and 1/2 cup dried red Asian chiles. Cook on high, stirring occasionally to prevent the ingredients from burning, for about 5 minutes, or until the ingredients are soft and slightly brown. Allow to cool. Puree in a food processor or blender. Reserve to add later to soup.

Theres a good chance losing Reyes is going to hurt more down the road than it hurts tonight. The Mets, who did little more than apply some spackle to fill their holes this offseason, are off to a respectable start.

5. When observers talk about Yadier Molina's improved power production, they invariably mention his increased home-run total in 2011, when he hit a career-high 14 homers. Take a look at the doubles. To me, Molina's rising double count is more indicative of his power stroke. Sure, he hits more homers than he did as a young player. But Molina's gap power has grown, and he just hits the ball harder and farther than he used to. The doubles prove that. Molina hit 32 doubles last season and already has 10 a month into 2012. Since the start of last season Molina's 42 doubles are the most among MLB catchers, and his slugging percentage of .484 is second among catchers to Detroit's Alex Avila (.493.) What a bonus this is for the Cardinals, to have baseball's best defensive catcher evolve into a productive and important hitter.

But your neighbors don't get to use your bathrooms. They do benefit from your trees. Donovan's study (PDF) found the average street tree increases the value of adjacent homes -- those within about 100 feet of the tree -- by a total of roughly $13,000. "What it means is, because you have someone bearing all the costs but not getting all of the benefits, you have too few trees from a community perspective," Donovan says.
The combination of a tepid economy, depressed power markets and costs of meeting tougher environmental regulations have already prompted utilities including Ameren Corp. to shutter older, dirtier and less efficient coal-fired power plants. While the new EPA proposal wouldn't affect plants that are already permitted or are being built now, including the massive Prairie State plant near Lively Grove, Ill., some observers believe it would not be cost-effective for utilities to build new coal-powered plants with today's technology.

We only have to look at other states to know what would happen if Michigan's law is repealed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that in the three years after Florida repealed its helmet law in 2000, 933 motorcyclists were killed, an 81% increase. Another study found that fatalities grew by more than 50% in Kentucky and 100% in Louisiana after those states struck down helmet laws.

Vinny, Pauly D, and Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino head out to a place The Situation calls "a Chuckie Cheese for dudes" and bond over air hockey and beers. (Now that I can get down with.) Pauly D: "We stayed boys throughout this whole thing. This bond that we shared brings us together and no one can ever take that away from us, ever. Like, we take that with us for life, this bond ... That was deep."
If you're looking for a hard-to-kill hanging houseplant, go no further than the pothos, or Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum). Pothos resemble a philodendron, but the leaves are thicker. The two most popular pothos are the cultivars 'Golden' and 'Marble Queen.'
As usual when traveling this road, my eyes scanned the yards in search of foliage. Over the years, I've found that older neighborhoods are the best places to find uncommon plants, especially those with edible fruit. I've discovered a wide array of edible and floral displays by driving slowly through lesser-traveled neighborhoods. I've also learned that when politely asked, homeowners are usually kind enough to let me pick my fill of fresh-off-the-tree-or-bush treats.
"He's one of the nicest guys you would want to have as your coach," Harris said. "He pushed me to become more competitive and more focused. He's really helpful and takes a lot of time  more time than you would think a pro runner could take."

"The important thing to note," said school spokeswoman Madeline Turnock, "is that while the recognition is going to be naming the Boise library, the gift is unrestricted and will support the university's expansion and growth."
I honestly do not remember who we played. I remember that day as the kids and I went hiking in the Columbia Gorge and then headed to the game. All I know is we won 2 to 1. Because we always win 2 to 1.
Leach said he expected many donors to stay on the sidelines until a frontrunner emerged.

If anyone should be frustrated, it's the United States and Israel. And there is no long-standing promise of a separate Palestinian state, not outside a negotiated end to the conflict that recognizes, according to U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, Israel's "right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries."

As a result, the race on the 1.97-mile, 11-turn course will start with those penalized drivers hurriedly trying to pass to reach the front, and "that's going to make the race a lot more exciting," said Tony Kanaan, the 2004 series champion who drives a Chevy-powered car for KV Racing Technology.
Browne, the NYPD spokesman, flatly denied the accounts of mosque crawlers and rakers. He said the NYPD only uses undercover officers and informants to follow leads, not to target ethnic neighborhoods.

A. Yes. Comprehensive care of patients with MS means addressing the many aspects of a patient's life. Access to a diverse array of interventions is important including rehabilitation therapies, mental health counseling, assistive devices, and interventions that address bladder and sexual dysfunction. Complementary therapies that may be effective in improving fatigue and enhancing the quality of life include yoga and exercise. Tai Chi has been reported to improve balance. Vitamin D may have a role in immune regulation, however, its use should be discussed with the physician. There are also a variety of dietary supplements that are thought worthy of investigating further in MS.

Baltimore Racing Development was able to promote the race, but they fell short on knowing how to run one. Yet I am sure another organization can be put together that will bring a successful race to fruition in a very short time. The infrastructure is now here.

As it stands now, Iowa reflects the Republican Party's lack of clarity when it comes to the crowded GOP field and its increasingly urgent search for a candidate who can defeat Democratic President Barack Obama next fall.
Which brings us back to the madness. What, most fundamentally, should Mr. Samad now ask of us  of our government, of me, or of my family? Whatever his questions, I'm not sure I'd have any answers for him. I'm also not sure anyone responsible for our military involvement in and around his village will have any answers for him either.

The 2008 Cuvee A Pinot Noir is light red with scents of cedar, spice, red fruit and a hint of chocolate. Peppery fruit is nicely smooth and round at first and balanced by lively tannins. The pepper carries through to the finish. It's a delightful expression of this beloved Burgundian grape.
This year, though, he's betting again that the housing market will recover, and for an interesting reason: hormones.

A simple stopgap to thin the crowds would be some additional live shows beyond the tired and cliched "Bill & Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure." Horror Nights dropped the campy "Rocky Horror" tribute in the Terminator theater and the "SlaughterWorld" show in the WaterWorld theater without filling the lineup with new entertainment.
After all, Epstein put an end to the curse - and cursing - in Boston by guiding the Red Sox to World Series championships in 2004 and 2007. The Red Sox had gone 86 years without capturing a World Series until Epstein ended the torment.

Something my resume does not have is a front office piece to it, no doubt about that, Porter said. That being said, (Boston Celtics President of Basketball Operations) Danny Ainge didnt have that. And there have been other GMs who didnt have that, who had that hole but went on to have success. Its about putting together a team and understanding personnel.

The accident happened about 12:25 a.m. roughly a mile north of Beaver Ruin Road. Steve Reynolds Boulevard is five lanes wide at the spot where Widemans SUV swerved out of control. The speed limit is 45 mph; Gwinnett police say Wideman was driving faster than that.
But the hyacinth quickly spread to natural waters, where it breeds prolifically. Under the right conditions, it completely carpets the surface of Delta sloughs and canals, where it tangles propellers and clogs cooling water intakes on boats.
For its part, the DEP says "serious conflicts" between humans and bears increased 96 percent between 2006 and last year. Patrick Carr, a senior biologist for the DEP, said today the state received 3,804 complaints about bear activity last year.

At Monday's meeting, Zurschmeide questioned why the board had a policy it didn't strictly follow, saying that by allowing multiple exceptions and changing the policy year after year, the board appears to be without a backbone.
But the new case presents challenges even Browne has rarely had to face  countering forensic evidence gathered by military investigators from a nearly inaccessible village half a globe away; eliciting sympathy for Bales' stressful combat deployments and previous brain injury from a panel of Army jurors; and playing the "put the war on trial" strategy to a U.S. Army tribunal.

Oregon GOP Chairman Allen Alley joined in using the #KorruptKate hashtag on Twitter and accused her of "manipulating the elections process" to help her fellow Democrats.

Lyme may be identified after a tick bite, for example, by an expanding rash that looks like a bull's-eye. But that doesn't always happen, and even after a tick bite, antibodies against Lyme may not show up for weeks, so early blood tests can turn up false negatives. Symptoms such as fatigue, chills, fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes may be misdiagnosed. Some infections can go undetected for months or even years. When caught early, tick-borne diseases can be treated successfully with two weeks of antibiotics, but doctors and researchers still argue about whether a chronic form of Lyme exists, and whether it should be treated with longer courses of the drugs.
Edible tomatillos are annuals, so if your plant has been around longer than a season, it may not be the edible variety. As with tomatoes, blossom drop in tomatillos can be caused by a number of factors, including nighttime temperatures below 55 degrees, daytime temperatures above 90, smog, excess nitrogen, too much shade, or early blossoms that naturally fall off.

The Rockies are going to hit. They were awful last year with runners in scoring position, unable to take advantage of their home park against pedestrian pitching. Marco Scutaro and Michael Cuddyer are better than players they replaced. The catching combination of Ramon Hernandez and Wilin Rosario could produce 25 home runs. The lineup is deeper.
The army is not unified on this, of course. What we have here is a rabid splinter group of fans that is splintered within itself. The TA is so divided that when I named the entire Timbers Army as one of the 25 Most Influential in Oregon Sports last summer, I asked dozens of members in the days before publication and couldn't get a straight answer on the organization's official motto.
Central Florida's rapidly growing app industry stands to win from the additional spectrum on which these applications operate.

It's a timely topic in light of Arizona State's search for a football coach. Does it pursue a big name? A promising coordinator? Does it extend its search nationally or look within? It's a decision that will define director of athletics Lisa Love's tenure and determine whether the Sun Devils can rises from the ashes of football mediocrity.
That's not to say that the election didn't expose deep differences between the parties. I ran for President because for much of the last decade, a very specific governing philosophy had reigned about how America should work:
This is the fifth year for MSNBC's after party. "It keeps getting better every year," Haller says. "This year we were going for hot and sexy."
So the call went to the bullpen, not for Wright or anyone else scheduled to be part of it this season, but to Lindblom.
Those that risk it often swerve out of their lane to avoid the worst holes, which isn't the safest practice along a route shared by Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority buses. Red brick shows through dozens of holes in the deteriorated pavement. Broken bricks in a few spots create craters that look to be at least 6-inches deep.
As for automatic debit, I personally use auto debit on only three things: My car payment, because I got a quarter-point discount on the interest rate for doing it automatically; my auto insurance, because my insurance company requires it if you're paying monthly; and my monthly life insurance premium, because that is one bill that I don't want to take a chance on it not getting paid.
The average Rutgers student pays $12,559 in annual tuition and fees before room and board and other costs are added. Next years tuition will be set in July.

Fox kept Prescott's hitters guessing, mixing up her placement and earning strikeouts almost every inning.
They take the actual winemaking as seriously as their ancestors took farmingwhich is to say deadly seriously, with a formidable will to make a first-rate and ultra-satisfying product. And when I got home and poured a little of that product for my skeptical wife, and saw the happy look once she'd gulped it, I knew that I had their target market right in my own bedroom.
For job forecasts, Chesapeake refers to an economic impact study released in September by the Ohio Oil & Gas Energy Education Program. It projects 200,000 new jobs in four years, should the gas deposits be as large as expected.
But Korver, who sat out Monday's practice to rest a minor injury or two, said: "It's the natural human tendency to think: I'm going to make this happen. We have to fight that. If anything, we have to play more as a team. We're used to Derrick taking big shots at the end of the game, but if we're going to win this, it will be because we played the best team basketball."
Moments earlier, Briere ended a harried Game 1 between the Devils and Philadelphia Flyers, sending a shot from out near the blue line past Martin Brodeur for a 4-3 Flyers victory in overtime.

BELICHICK vs. Steelers: At last! A Cleveland win over the Steelers!
While the 40-year-old O'Donnell will join the mix of defensemen on a regular basis after being a scratch for 30 of the Hawks' 75 games this season, Hjalmarsson will slide into Keith's spot on the top pairing alongside Brent Seabrook. For the most part, those two will be assigned the task of shutting down opponents' top lines.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Oracle and Google were facing off in the second day of a high-stakes intellectual property showdown in a San Francisco federal courtroom Tuesday when Twitter made a surprise announcement: It pledged that employees who created its technology would exercise control over the patents so they could not be used as a legal battering ram against other companies.

A multimillion-dollar campaign to woo voters into passing the biggest single infusion of infrastructure dollars in metro Atlanta in at least 40 years is under way. Expect a quiet launch against noisy opposition.
The city's anti-graffiti czar sympathizes with Eastman but says property owners need to take responsibility for stopping the epidemic of graffiti. The city already spends $1 million each year getting rid of it.

A Fox Sports spokesman declined to comment on the renewed speculation about a national sports channel, first reported by Bloomberg. But people familiar with the matter said there were no immediate plans for such a service and dismissed Bloomberg's report that a new channel could be launched as soon as late 2012.
"I thought our defense played really well today," UO coach Chip Kelly said. "They came up big in second-and-long. And (the offense) didn't move the ball on them in overtime. I thought our defense responded really well on Monday too. The offense needs to come to play."
I was a fan of the meat loaf ($18), about 8 ounces of beef formed into a silo-shape serving with a sauce that was both tangy and fruity, with a hint of Worcestershire flavor. The ground beef was cited as prime-grade sirloin from Niman Ranch, one of the few instances of name-dropping on the menu.

A minor gloss, but a very big deal for a writer who carried on such a vast correspondence as Pound. Is it possible, I wondered, that three generations of Pound enthusiasts have been making a partial pilgrimage at best?
If you are an Illuminating Co. customer, and use an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, your monthly bill will go up by $2.63 for three years, the PUCO said.
Wonderfully aromatic lemongrass and magrut leaves (also known as kaffir lime) combine with shallots, lime juice and less acidic unseasoned rice vinegar to give a citrusy lift to the briny oysters. Sweeter oysters like Kumamotos and Hog Islands won't overpower the wine; other types might leave a little iodine aftertaste on your palate unless the wine has a lot of mineral character.
"It was a cause of concern," the former aide testified.
That none are women doesn't trouble Berggruen. "They were picked one by one, not picked because they are old or young, have a beard or no beard," he explained.
And yet there is an anarchic spirit underlying this production that is so strong and absorbing  so entertaining  that it is impossible not to be swept up in its embrace.
After moving to the South, "I started writing these funny songs about my life because in Nashville, I'd take all these songwriting classes and each one said the same exact thing: Write about what you know. Write about what you know - it comes from a pure place, it comes from an honest place and it gives you a lot of material to write about,' " Fabisch said. "At that time I had two little kids, a lot of diapers and laundry and what should I make for dinner?' I just started writing songs about that . . . and sort of on the funny side. The audience really, really responded to it. They thought it was different and entertaining and so I kept going."
Round 2 was Songs They Wish They'd Written, which is somehow different than Contestant's Choice in "Idol"-speak (because apparently you'd choose a song you didn't wish you'd written).
We find an oil lamp, walls of what seems to be a house, drain channels. To the untrained eye like mine, it's an expanse of rocks. But to the experts, these things have specific meanings and functions. They figure out what's not original to the Iron Age-era city and tear down walls to uncover the original structures, and determine the purposes of a room and how it may have looked back in the Iron Age.
Shanahan, playing the role of pragmatic, close-to-the-chest coach to the very end, even tried his best to leave just the slightest doubt that the Redskins might not get Griffin, claiming that there was a "one percent of one percent" chance that the choice will be Andrew Luck instead.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  Urban farmers need access to U.S. Agriculture Department credit programs just like their rural counterparts and Congress should accommodate their needs when it crafts the next farm bill, inner-city Cleveland farmer Michael Walton told a House subcommittee on Thursday.
Matt Vensel, reporter: Its tough to forecast how good each NFL team will be when the schedule is released in April. The draft has yet to go down, there will still be free-agency tinkering, and injuries start to come into play as soon as the pads come on at training camp. Plus, all it takes is a couple of early-season wins for an overlooked squad to suddenly become dangerous (see Detroit and San Francisco last year). Here's what I do know: Teams with top quarterbacks are usually formidable. And the Ravens will have to deal with Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger (twice), Philip Rivers, Michael Vick, Tony Romo, and Matt Schaub. Andy Dalton tested the Ravens last year, too. And some are predicting a Cam Newton-type rookie impact for Robert Griffin III. Of course, the Ravens have a pretty good quarterback, too, and one of the most balanced rosters in the league, so five months out from Week 1, I would love to say that the Ravens will probably be back in the playoffs in January. But football happens, so Im going to pass on making a win-loss prediction until training camp wraps up out at The Castle.
After Johnny Depp's brief, but very funny cameo in the recent comedy "21 Jump Street," I found myself wondering about his sense of humor and whether the guy even possessed one.
In Vermont, the possibility loomed that the gubernatorial election between Democrat Peter Shumlin and Republican Brian Dubie might be left for the Legislature to settle in January.

Warren claims that his views are mainstream, pointing out that in 30 states, the majority of voters have banned gay marriage. Popular doesn't mean right, of course, but regardless of what Americans think about gay marriage, on other so-called social issues, he's way out in far-right field.

Reporting from Charleston, S.C. -- Under the looming live oaks at the College of Charleston on Friday, Stephen Colbert delivered a clinic on how to produce a whiz-bang political rally. Significantly, not one of the Republican candidates this year has exhibited the star power to bring off such an extravaganza themselves.
Drew, 55, is one of two women who sit on the New York-based firm's operating committee. Her office oversees about $360 billion, the difference between money from deposits and what the bank extends in loans. Dimon, 56, had pushed the unit to boost profit by buying higher-yielding assets, including structured credit, equities and derivatives, two former employees have said. The shift to riskier bets underscores how blurry the line can be between so-called proprietary trading and what banks say is hedging.
These crime statistics reflect citations from Peoria's Southeast Zone, also known as the "red zone," over the last three years. The 2010 statistics are through mid-August.

Decades ago, Baltimore County was divided into 15 election districts. They no longer have any real function in elections, but they remain the basis for apportionment of liquor licenses. In general, one "on-sale" license  that is, a bar or restaurant license  may be issued for every 2,500 people. Randallstown is the only part of the county that is undersubscribed when it comes to licenses, and because of grandfathering, one district, on the county's east side, is vastly oversubscribed. The Dundalk area, by population, should have about 42 licenses, but it actually has 125. Licenses can be bought and sold within a district (provided that the county liquor board approves of the new owner), but they cannot be sold across district lines without a special dispensation from the General Assembly, which controls county liquor laws.

If Felice's Urban Cafe were a shop, it would be the funky, indie boutique that makes you rethink colors, patterns and textures. The Larchmere shopping strip is all the better for this restored turn-of-the-20th-century home-turned-restaurant. Definitely a nighttime destination, the arty rooms glow in ambient lighting, creating a bohemian yet chic atmosphere. The menu is as eclectic as the decor. A number of specials fuse unusual combinations: a braised lamb shank entree is topped with cheese lasagna and a fried egg. Appetizers such as a grilled octopus and avocado salad stress the Spanish influence on what is essentially creative, chef-driven fare. The regular menu is a casual assortment of bistro standards such as hanger steak and frites. A wine list with many affordable options also reflects a mix of Spain and the Americas. Save room for dessert: A serving of French toast is complemented by the fluffiest whipped cream imaginable.

July 2008: Lost Continent's Flying Unicorn coaster and Enchanted Oak Tavern close. (Enchanted Oak later is leveled to make room for Potter projects.) Bridge is built over IOA waterway to bypass Wizarding World yet still connect Lost Continent and Jurassic Park areas. Result is public view of construction and popular photo opportunity.
While still in Nevada, after arriving for his shift on a mild day bathed in brilliant sunshine, Nelson received a battlefield briefing and then opened the door to his office -- the ground control station. He settled into the cockpit seat, known to pilots as the "Naugahyde Barcalounger," facing computer screens displaying live images from the mountains of Afghanistan -- color during the day, black-and-white at night.

He and Thelonious Monk Jr. brought me on board ... Conversations with Tom Carter brought this idea for UNESCO to declare an International Jazz Day. And it was Tom Carter's idea that it be in April because it's Jazz Appreciation Month. That made a lot of sense. ...

Anatomy of a Disintegrating Friendship: Gretchen and Alexis
The direction shows a real feel for its working-class Boston characters and a surprising comfort with action scenes. And Afflecks own performance as the leader of a gang of armored-car thieves brings to life the kind of character hes best at  the good-looking guy who realizes hes been luckier than he deserves, the morally compromised antihero who hates himself but still cant help himself.

As a mediating presence between past and future, the Gonzalez Goodale design manages well enough, and a collection of public art woven into the campus effectively engages the hotel's complex history without having to mimic its architectural forms. The new construction, for the most part, is confidently contemporary and free of ornament, if also decidedly risk-averse. The dominant formal gesture is a series of oversized entryways wrapped in zinc.
The story of Chen's escape from home detention, protection by U.S. diplomats, hospitalization and reunification with his family, and sudden desire to leave China for America has overshadowed the fourth annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two nations.
The thick slice of Wagyu beef was excellent, but diminished by the clutter of whole turnips, carrots and an underseasoned pile of maitake mushrooms that needed an element to integrate them into the dish. The splatters of green sauce and swirls of what looked like carrot puree weren't enough to really taste, and did little to improve the main ingredient.
That town gossip structure, having people talk about events rather than show them, was written into the screenplay. The unusual storytelling method proved problematic for Linklater as he sought to raise financing for the project, which ended up costing about $5 million.

By the door, a list of house rules is posted that telegraphs just what kind of crowd and behavior Rye is going for: "Training wheels discouraged," "No clumsy advances." This is counsel we should all take to heart.
End government bailouts, corporate welfare, unwinnable wars and massive income-redistribution schemes. Shrink government and its attendant debts and deficits. Tie money to something other than the empty promises of politicians, as it used to be. Then our pennies and the rest of our money will be worth something again.
A wave of bungled assassination attempts this week, pretty clearly masterminded from Tehran, show that the Iranian regimes reach, at least for now, is no match for its ambitions.

Look at the situation. They pushed the Pats all over the field during the first 15 minutes. And then Brady hit them in the chops as the clock ran down for the first half and for all their good work, they left the field trailing. After all that down and dirty work in the first quarter and to see it threaten to evaporate, you knew they were special when they came back after intermission and continued to hammer  hammer  hammer.
Within a year, Morrow was performing in local dance bands, and by 15 he was playing at college dances and parties with the Yale Collegians.

Baltimore Ravens' offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie is trying to "slim down" to 350 pounds. Anything lighter, he says, invites getting pushed around.
Along the way, Zazi spotted the tail and aborted the plot.
In the case of this plant, looking at its deep, narrow cup that unfurls into a floppy roof with a cylindrical spadix inside, reaching almost to the roof, I can imagine the scene. To an imaginative plant lover long ago, the oblong interior structure brought to mind the minister Jack, while the leafy shelter resembled an old-fashioned pulpit.
But the centerpiece of BMW's global success, the 3 Series, helped push the German automaker into its most successful sales year to date in 2011. It sold more than 1.38 million BMW vehicles -- a 13% rise from the prior year. Global sales for all brands including Mini and Rolls-Royce were 1.66 million.

But OLS predicts revenue collections will actually grow by 6.3 percent, which would still be the highest in the nation but about $392 million below Christies projections. The office is estimating that revenues in the current budget will fall short of the administrations estimates by $144 million.
We suspect you're worried because you've heard about the recall of some metal on metal hip implants, especially those made by DePuy.

The NCAA rule in this case is a good one. Julius Erving and Michael Jordan made such putbacks in the NBA. It is almost impossible to box out a player who has built up a full head of steam on a free throw deliberately missed to his side of the lane.

The National Football League Players Association has already warned Saints players of the potential for criminal charges as a result of the bounty program that paid players for injuring specified opponents, and the union has also provided those players with outside counsel in anticipation of pointed questions.

By his senior season, Nieses velocity touched 90 mph and he was on the rise. His nickname was Jonchalant, because his reaction to success was so casual. In 78 innings that year, he allowed a single earned run, drubbing hitters with his heater and curveball. A seventh-round pick, he signed for $175,000 and intended to dominate once more. Then, in his first Gulf Coast League start that summer, he noticed his jack-hammering heart and quivering legs.

We told Mrs. Linn that Mr. Mann was looking for her. They spoke by phone last week - a private conversation.
What struck me was the caliber of the players who showed up Monday to support their teammate and a good cause. There were quarterback Joe Flacco and running back Ray Rice, two young faces of the franchise who are engaged in contract talks with the team, chatting with fans. There was cornerback Lardarius Webb, who recently signed a $50 million extension, posing for pictures. And there were offensive tackle Michael Oher and wide receiver Torrey Smith, who both give back as much as they can after enduring challenging upbringings, serving up steak dinners.

Reichling noted that the water flowing from the dam, about 15,000 cfs, was about the same that had been released during much of the spring because of heavy runoff, and so the likelihood of people being in the water's path was low.

On today's Ledger Live video, my sense of wonder over Christie's joking about the scandal leads me to some bizarre theories over why the pit bull governor suddenly sounded so soft.
The three major candidates should agree to raising and spending the same amount of money, say, $75,000 per week for the remaining three weeks of this primary campaign. Hopefully, they then wouldn't have to turn to those special interests with a financial stake in government spending. Certainly they wouldn't be so desperate for funding.

Dominic returns 14 players as it looks for a three-peat. With Brett Stiffler (8 goals, 4 assists) unable to start the season due to injury, twin brother Scott (6, 2) will take up the slack in the midfield along with sophomore Stephen Koeller. Zac Walsh (8, 2) returns up top, while Class 2 goalkeeper of the year Travis Abt (22 wins, 18 shutouts, 0.64 GAA) provides stability for the defense.

5. If you're a get-in-the-car-and-hit-the-road kind of traveler  and 80% to 90% of California vacationers do go by car, the Auto Club of Southern California says  you won't be immune from those aforementioned fuel-price increases, and you'll probably pay more for a roof over your head (see next item). Gasoline may top $5 a gallon by Memorial Day, GasBuddy.com has said. But Jeff Spring of the Auto Club noted that if the economy improves, the price increases may not affect the number of people who travel. They'll grin and bear it or trim the length of their trip. American citizens, though, may have more company from abroad wherever they go: President Obama, hoping to increase travel to the U.S., recently issued an order asking for improvements in the visa process that would help foreign visitors with entry and asked for the creation of a task force that would promote the U.S.

The national economic trend favors Obama, too. Unemployment is down significantly from its 10% peak in October 2009. No incumbent president dating to 1956 has lost when unemployment fell over the two years leading up to his re-election contest. And none has won when the rate rose.

A: It would probably expand beyond San Diego. I think this nation is coming dangerously close to a tipping point in terms of the expectations of too many people that someone else is going to take care of them.

Dr. Sonia Michail, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, says the basic idea behind so-called immunity-boosting probiotics makes sense. As she explains, the gut is a major front in the immune system's war against pathogens, and the immune cells there must respond to the resident bacteria. If helpful bacteria can activate immune cells in the gut, the disease fighters will spread throughout the body.

Now, it's time for Nick to visit Monroe, to get this week's batch of creature exposition. The rat people (Old Man Geiger's one, too) are Reinigen. Oh, and the name of the private school? Von Hamelin Institute. Of course. I should be paying more attention to this scene, but I'm hypnotized by the big, public school-type clock on Monroe's kitchen wall. As we cut back and forth between Nick and Monroe, I'm watching to see if the minute hand moves. It does, a bit. Fun with continuity!

Lowery is not well known among Maryland's local superintendents, some of whom say they have met her at education conferences and meetings but do not know her personally.
Today's Che lovefest is a marked departure from the state of affairs 40 years ago, when villagers expressed suspicion and mystification. In his diary of the Bolivian campaign, Guevara writes that he was despondent about the hostility of the locals he had come to liberate, so distinct from the peasants of Cuba's Sierra Maestra.
He remembers a grizzly bear he and his father saw at the zoo; he knows that bear has something to do with his father's death and something to do with his young life. The 800-pound bear, in the meantime, has escaped from a cargo boat in the North Atlantic and swum to shore. It lives in a cave in the Outer Hebrides.

In retrospect, I can see that both of us were suffering from some misapprehensions. I thought she was French Canadian and linked in with the circus community in Montreal. She was in fact from Portland, Ore., and had been in town for three days. She thought I lived in Montreal and was linked into the circus community in Montreal. I don't and I'm not. I'm also not French Canadian.
It's surprisingly easy to pick up. A few weeks ago, in Columbus, I took part in a morninglong seminar, and came away feeling as though I had it down pat.

You can order a combination platter if you want to try several different things, or choose from the appetizers, entrees, side dishes and about eight homemade desserts. Prices are extremely reasonable, there's a depth of flavor in every bite and even the falafel ($7) is a surprise. Instead of the usual deep-fried brown brick, it's a large, quickly fried round ball with a light, soft green, ground chick pea and fava bean center seasoned with fresh herbs. Same with the kibbi ($7). I'm used to an over-baked ball of lamb and cracked bulghur wheat, but Hage's is shaped like slices of meat loaf, loaded with sauted onions and pine nuts and served with fresh yogurt and cucumbers. Delicious.
I went because: I've always wanted to circumnavigate the Sea of Corts -- drive down the Baja Peninsula, take the ferry across, then come back up the Sonora coast.

"I was kind of skeptical at first about going to a community college," he says. But the tuition savings of nearly $40,000 convinced him. Students earning a partnership degree pay community college rates for their first two or even three years of coursework.
