Shellfish entrees are better, notably day boat scallops that let all their sweetness come through -- although supporting it with chorizo and butter provides an odd base for such a delicate crustacean. Best is a lobster tail, which is not only vivid and lightly butter-poached, but has some more support; you might find yourself sneaking other fish onto this plate.

1. The first step is to make garlic chile paste, the ingredient that gives the soup its robust flavor. The paste, called nam prig pao, is made by dicing 4 large garlic cloves and thinly slicing 1/4 of a red onion. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil on high heat in a saute pan. When hot, add garlic, onion and 1/2 cup dried red Asian chiles. Cook on high, stirring occasionally to prevent the ingredients from burning, for about 5 minutes, or until the ingredients are soft and slightly brown. Allow to cool.

In context: The offense and team record regressed to 4-12 under first-year coach Shurmur and McCoy, who was handed the starting job from Day One. Rookie mistakes and uncanny slip-ups cost the team probably two or three wins. If building through the draft is the road to success, the Browns have a nucleus of first- and second-year players on which to build, namely defensive backs Joe Haden and T.J. Ward, defensive linemen Phil Taylor and Jabaal Sheard and wide receiver Greg Little. The team's 2011 draft class started a combined league–high 66 games.

5. When observers talk about Yadier Molina's improved power production, they invariably mention his increased home-run total in 2011, when he hit a career-high 14 homers. Take a look at the doubles. To me, Molina's rising double count is more indicative of his power stroke. Sure, he hits more homers than he did as a young player. But Molina's gap power has grown, and he just hits the ball harder and farther than he used to. The doubles prove that. Molina hit 32 doubles last season and already has 10 a month into 2012. Since the start of last season Molina's 42 doubles are the most among MLB catchers, and his slugging percentage of .484 is second among catchers to Detroit's Alex Avila (.493.) What a bonus this is for the Cardinals, to have baseball's best defensive catcher evolve into a productive and important hitter.

The combination of a tepid economy, depressed power markets and costs of meeting tougher environmental regulations have already prompted utilities including Ameren Corp. to shutter older, dirtier and less efficient coal-fired power plants.

As usual when traveling this road, my eyes scanned the yards in search of foliage. Over the years, I've found that older neighborhoods are the best places to find uncommon plants, especially those with edible fruit. I've discovered a wide array of edible and floral displays by driving slowly through lesser-traveled neighborhoods. I've also learned that when politely asked, homeowners are usually kind enough to let me pick my fill of fresh-off-the-tree-or-bush treats.

The proposed constitutional amendment — which would have to pass the Legislature and be approved by voters statewide — is modeled after Proposition 2½, adopted by Massachusetts voters in the 1980s. But while that proposal also capped property taxes at 2.5 percent of the assessed value of a community’s property, New Jersey — where many communities already exceed that threshold — would only adopt the piece limiting annual increases to 2.5 percent.

But the new case presents challenges even Browne has rarely had to face — countering forensic evidence gathered by military investigators from a nearly inaccessible village half a globe away; eliciting sympathy for Bales' stressful combat deployments and previous brain injury from a panel of Army jurors; and playing the "put the war on trial" strategy to a U.S. Army tribunal.

Lyme may be identified after a tick bite, for example, by an expanding rash that looks like a bull's-eye. But that doesn't always happen, and even after a tick bite, antibodies against Lyme may not show up for weeks, so early blood tests can turn up false negatives. Symptoms such as fatigue, chills, fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes may be misdiagnosed. Some infections can go undetected for months or even years. When caught early, tick-borne diseases can be treated successfully with two weeks of antibiotics, but doctors and researchers still argue about whether a chronic form of Lyme exists, and whether it should be treated with longer courses of the drugs.
Edible tomatillos are annuals, so if your plant has been around longer than a season, it may not be the edible variety.

The army is not unified on this, of course. What we have here is a rabid splinter group of fans that is splintered within itself.

As for automatic debit, I personally use auto debit on only three things: My car payment, because I got a quarter-point discount on the interest rate for doing it automatically; my auto insurance, because my insurance company requires it if you're paying monthly; and my monthly life insurance premium, because that is one bill that I don't want to take a chance on it not getting paid.

They take the actual winemaking as seriously as their ancestors took farming—which is to say deadly seriously, with a formidable will to make a first-rate and ultra-satisfying product.

To some extent, though, we all have to decide for ourselves what’s useful. So, dear readers, which is it? Are you looking for help with consumer choices -- whether to buy or not? Or are you interested in reviews as a way to compare your own interpretations of the art, or perhaps as a kind of proxy experience for the art itself? Do you read reviews to learn what to think about a show (or book or whatever)? Or to discover options for how to think about it?

"At that time I had two little kids, a lot of diapers and laundry and what should I make for dinner?' I just started writing songs about that . . . and sort of on the funny side.

Matt Vensel, reporter: It’s tough to forecast how good each NFL team will be when the schedule is released in April. The draft has yet to go down, there will still be free-agency tinkering, and injuries start to come into play as soon as the pads come on at training camp. Plus, all it takes is a couple of early-season wins for an overlooked squad to suddenly become dangerous (see Detroit and San Francisco last year). Here's what I do know: Teams with top quarterbacks are usually formidable. And the Ravens will have to deal with Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger (twice), Philip Rivers, Michael Vick, Tony Romo, and Matt Schaub. Andy Dalton tested the Ravens last year, too. And some are predicting a Cam Newton-type rookie impact for Robert Griffin III. Of course, the Ravens have a pretty good quarterback, too, and one of the most balanced rosters in the league, so five months out from Week 1, I would love to say that the Ravens will probably be back in the playoffs in January. But football happens, so I’m going to pass on making a win-loss prediction until training camp wraps up out at The Castle.

It's not uncommon to have to put these patients to sleep in order to do tooth extractions and multiple fillings, says Mungo. Often, these are children who have gone to bed with a bottle of milk or formula since they were infants.

I read Jill Rosen's article on Baltimore advertisers not pulling ads from Rush Limbaugh's show ("In Baltimore, advertisers appear unfazed," March 7) and came away perplexed about what this says about both listeners and advertisers in Baltimore. WCBM general manger Bob Pettit attributes complaints to the station to "liberal activists" in an "attempt to silence the voice of conservative radio."
In the case of “Tiny Toons,” Warner Bros. made an old favorite new again without changing the formula, just the subjects. “Tiny Toons” was the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. The partnership was so successful, especially among adults, that “Animaniacs” quickly followed. Just like the original, these shows were a blend of sight gags, wackiness, pop culture references, and stylized, animated violence.
The Republican measure would keep the payroll tax that about 160 million American workers pay at 4.2 percent in 2012, the same as it has been this year. It is normally 6.2 percent. Obama proposed trimming the levy to 3.1 percent and giving reductions to employers as well.

When she's home, Bley dedicates several hours a day to writing. When we spoke, she was working on an arrangement of "Away in a Manger" for a forthcoming European tour (with Swallow and a brass quintet) and a subsequent recording of all Christmas carols. "I decided to write it as a Palestinian piece, because while I know Jesus was a Jew, everybody was sort of mixed up in those days — they were all Palestinian," she explained. "So I changed the melody to a minor key, and I wrote it in groups of five instead of four, and it's like 'Away in a Palestinian Manger,' virtually. Interesting."
Though sweet-natured and sincere, the servers piled our entrees on our table well before we were done with our appetizers -- a frustrating practice that was noted when The Chronicle first reviewed the restaurant two years ago. It was the one glitch that detracted from an otherwise neighborly experience in a restaurant that has found its niche.
Decades ago, Baltimore County was divided into 15 election districts. They no longer have any real function in elections, but they remain the basis for apportionment of liquor licenses. In general, one "on-sale" license — that is, a bar or restaurant license — may be issued for every 2,500 people. Randallstown is the only part of the county that is undersubscribed when it comes to licenses, and because of grandfathering, one district, on the county's east side, is vastly oversubscribed. The Dundalk area, by population, should have about 42 licenses, but it actually has 125. Licenses can be bought and sold within a district (provided that the county liquor board approves of the new owner), but they cannot be sold across district lines without a special dispensation from the General Assembly, which controls county liquor laws.

The Food 52 Cookbook: The first crowd-sourced cookbook from Food52.com - an online cooking community featuring weekly recipe contests - reads somewhat like a binder of random clippings and margin notes, in the best way. You'll find everything from wild ramp pesto to pudding chomeur, a decadent maple-and cream-soaked baked biscuit (see recipe). The beauty of this book is how well the recipes have been vetted - not only by authors and Food 52 creators Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, but also by the community of cooks who submitted them.
Troy Wallin, who milks 300 cows and farms 350 acres near the planned Enumclaw digester site, said, "There's been four different companies that were gonna come in and do this." The others were stymied by King County's stringent environmental rules, among other things, he said.

It does make sense to take one adult-strength aspirin, which prevents blood clots and may help keep an artery partially open. Chewing it will get it into your bloodstream quicker than swallowing it. The brand doesn't matter, as long as it's uncoated. Tylenol, Advil and other pain-relievers that aren't aspirin-based won't have the same effect.

After that, St. Joseph's had three chances to pull ahead and couldn't do it before stepping ahead 23-21 on a short hook by Ronald Roberts.
The examples at this point are beyond numerous enough to establish that most toxic of media fixations: a narrative. Journalists like typecasting politicians. Sarah Palin could announce she's solved pi to the last digit and reconciled all of the inconsistencies in the TV show "Lost," and The New York Times would still call her an idiot. Mr. Gore could kill a man in a bar fight with a broken pool cue, and he'd still be a cold fish.

I had a practice for five years and then my daughter was born, and I had some medical complications, so I cut back the practice.

The proof is in the devil's food. In one of our studies, we put three groups of subjects alone in a room with a very large piece of chocolate cake, the utensils to devour it and water. We told them they could eat as much or as little cake as they wished. But first, the members of one group were instructed to focus on the pride they would feel if they resisted the cake. Those in the second group were told to imagine the shame they would feel if they ate it, and the final (control) group was simply let loose, with no instructions at all.
Likewise, conservatives will also need to compromise. In a recent column in The New York Times, Tom Friedman wrote about the new book by Ed Luce, “Time to Start Thinking: America in the Age of Descent.” Luce made the point that it is a fantasy to think that America’s economic success is derived from having had a government that stayed out of the way. And Friedman wrote that “if you have a proper understanding of history ... you know that government played a vital role in generating growth by ... promulgating regulations that incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, educating the work force, building infrastructure and funding scientific research.”

If Felice's Urban Cafe were a shop, it would be the funky, indie boutique that makes you rethink colors, patterns and textures. The Larchmere shopping strip is all the better for this restored turn-of-the-20th-century home-turned-restaurant. Definitely a nighttime destination, the arty rooms glow in ambient lighting, creating a bohemian yet chic atmosphere. The menu is as eclectic as the decor. A number of specials fuse unusual combinations: a braised lamb shank entree is topped with cheese lasagna and a fried egg. Appetizers such as a grilled octopus and avocado salad stress the Spanish influence on what is essentially creative, chef-driven fare. The regular menu is a casual assortment of bistro standards such as hanger steak and frites. A wine list with many affordable options also reflects a mix of Spain and the Americas. Save room for dessert: A serving of French toast is complemented by the fluffiest whipped cream imaginable.

There's more to recommend on the 14-track collection, including a bold remix of Evanescence's New Way to Bleed, Shinedown's potent I'm Alive and hard-rocking Count Me Out, the debut by PusherJones, the Gorillaz-like cartoon band conceived by Velvet Revolver's Dave Kushner and The Simpsons' creative director Dave Warren. - Edna Gundersen

Rather, it's because the state's Office of Administration told the department and other state agencies that any potential funding increases next year would have to be accompanied by corresponding budget cuts from those same agencies. State revenue collections are apparently not looking so good.
"He's definitely healthier than when he showed up to us last year in September," manager Jim Tracy said. "I think with his fastball and his curveball, there is evidence of that. There is more life to his pitches. And there is no getting around the fact that he had a tremendous spring training."

My hope for the industry is that next year is the year of improving customer care and making sure every effort is made to avert foreclosure."
Syria's pro-government al-Ekhbariya TV aired footage of the aftermath from the blasts, showing torn flesh, smashed cars, twisted debris and blood stains on the pavement.

Pro-government websites said five buildings damaged.
The tactics employed by the Impact Division are not new, nor unique to the Sheriff's Department. But officials say the manpower the grant has enabled is critical: The division has the capacity to handle labor-intensive investigations. Its officers can be proactive as well as reactive.
Feldman acknowledges she has a lot to learn but says her energy will compensate.
If the map is approved, Democrats could still challenge it through a referendum, assuming the emergency clause fails. But they would have to start the process all over again and would likely miss out on being able to use Election Day to gather signatures outside polling locations.

"Everybody and their mother and their lawyer showed up," said Jerry Buzzard, then the state's child welfare manager in Hillsboro. There was a debate, Buzzard remembers, about whether Adrianna's biological mother, Tausha Cram, should be told of her death. Legally, the lawyers pointed out, she had no rights as a parent as she'd lost them because of neglect.
Edwards contends that despite the cuts, improvements in protocol have helped CPS stay on top of cases. The agency uses a decision-making process that requires social workers to answer key questions about an incident, the child and the family.

Anatomy of a Disintegrating Friendship: Gretchen and Alexis
The direction shows a real feel for its working-class Boston characters and a surprising comfort with action scenes. And Affleck’s own performance as the leader of a gang of armored-car thieves brings to life the kind of character he’s best at — the good-looking guy who realizes he’s been luckier than he deserves, the morally compromised antihero who hates himself but still can’t help himself.
When one of his professors suggested he study in Spain, Carey left the country for several years. He returned and continued his studies, receiving his master's degree in Spanish in 1980 and marrying a young schoolteacher in 1981.

As a mediating presence between past and future, the Gonzalez Goodale design manages well enough, and a collection of public art woven into the campus effectively engages the hotel's complex history without having to mimic its architectural forms. The new construction, for the most part, is confidently contemporary and free of ornament, if also decidedly risk-averse. The dominant formal gesture is a series of oversized entryways wrapped in zinc.

The story of Chen's escape from home detention, protection by U.S. diplomats, hospitalization and reunification with his family, and sudden desire to leave China for America has overshadowed the fourth annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two nations.
The thick slice of Wagyu beef was excellent, but diminished by the clutter of whole turnips, carrots and an underseasoned pile of maitake mushrooms that needed an element to integrate them into the dish. The splatters of green sauce and swirls of what looked like carrot puree weren't enough to really taste, and did little to improve the main ingredient.

She didn't come back empty-handed, either.
Kinzel's retirement package, meanwhile, is dependant on the price of Cedar Fair's stock when he exits the company. If he had retired last year, his stock, pension and health benefit package would have totaled $8.7 million.

A wave of bungled assassination attempts this week, pretty clearly masterminded from Tehran, show that the Iranian regime’s reach, at least for now, is no match for its ambitions.
But if the Supreme Court upholds the law in the middle of next year's election campaign, the likely political result is a backlash that will favor the Republicans. Nothing would more effectively inflame the GOP base, or assure that those voters turn out in November, than being told by the Supreme Court that Obamacare is here to stay unless the country elects a Republican Congress and president to repeal it.
As the second day of storm cleanup ended, residents dealt with tasks smaller than those of previous days.
Troy Brouwer's redirection off a Matt Hendricks dish narrowly missed the net wide right five minutes into the first extra session, and Alex Ovechkin caused a turnover in the left circle with five minutes to go, but his shot rolled and hit the right post.

Look at the situation. They pushed the Pats all over the field during the first 15 minutes. And then Brady hit them in the chops as the clock ran down for the first half and for all their good work, they left the field trailing. After all that down and dirty work in the first quarter and to see it threaten to evaporate, you knew they were special when they came back after intermission and continued to hammer … hammer … hammer.

Baltimore Ravens' offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie is trying to "slim down" to 350 pounds. Anything lighter, he says, invites getting pushed around.
Along the way, Zazi spotted the tail and aborted the plot.
In the case of this plant, looking at its deep, narrow cup that unfurls into a floppy roof with a cylindrical spadix inside, reaching almost to the roof, I can imagine the scene. To an imaginative plant lover long ago, the oblong interior structure brought to mind the minister “Jack,” while the leafy shelter resembled an old-fashioned pulpit.
But the centerpiece of BMW's global success, the 3 Series, helped push the German automaker into its most successful sales year to date in 2011.

Most of them said they didn't know or didn't care about the details that have landed the seven-term congressman in the public eye: the loss of top staffers, inappropriate pill use, and a campaign meltdown where aides begged him to seek psychiatric help.
We were in a strange position among Americans. Before we left, we frequently had to explain where Dubrovnik is on the map. While we were en route, however, experienced backpackers kept telling us that Croatia was too crowded, old news, and, worst of all, touristy. We were straddling the line between the tame and the exotic; it was Frommers versus Lonely Planet. It was exactly where we wanted to be.

The Big 12 was hit hard two years ago and wound up losing Nebraska to the Big Ten, Colorado to the Pac-12 and, as of July 1, Texas A&M and Missouri to the Southeastern Conference. Beebe was booted in September as Oklahoma, Texas and others were flirting with the Pac-12 and the Big 12 seemed on the brink of falling apart.
Revis has spoken candidly this offseason about the Jets' chemistry issues last year, even describing the locker room as "in disarray right now" in a word association game on ESPN's SportsCenter this spring. But he said it "feels good" to be back.
It's possible Jordan is a lost soul, uncertain about what to do in a world where his court skills don't matter except for what they evoke. That's a tough spot to be in, money be damned.

A Sept. 30 letter to Orange’s business administrator from Essex County Counsel James Paganelli details three options: an outright sale of the 100 acres of waterway for $600,000, based on a state Green Acres appraisal; a sale of the 4.45-acre piece by the mini-golf course for $26,700; or the $2,670 annual lease.
The lands department is working from a 2006 asset management plan that calls for it to shed timber and rangeland that is difficult to manage or not producing enough money for the school fund -- the department's primary duty since statehood in 1859.

We suspect you're worried because you've heard about the recall of some metal on metal hip implants, especially those made by DePuy. While recalls and lawsuits are going on, in fact only a small fraction of the more than half a million people in North American who've gotten all-metal hip implants during the past decade have suffered injuries from the devices.

The National Football League Players Association has already warned Saints players of the potential for criminal charges as a result of the bounty program that paid players for injuring specified opponents, and the union has also provided those players with outside counsel in anticipation of pointed questions. More recently, Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, an eyewitness to Torres' devastating hit on Blackhawks' star Marian Hossa last Tuesday, called it "borderline criminal conduct" in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.

Disneyland announced that it's loosened up its legendary dress code — known as the Disney Look — to allow employees to grow more facial hair. But the rules still forbid visible tattoos, body piercings (other than the ears for women), "extreme" hairstyles or colors. (Shaved heads are OK for men, but a no-go for women.)
By his senior season, Niese’s velocity touched 90 mph and he was on the rise. His nickname was “Jonchalant,” because his reaction to success was so casual. In 78 innings that year, he allowed a single earned run, drubbing hitters with his heater and curveball. A seventh-round pick, he signed for $175,000 and intended to dominate once more. Then, in his first Gulf Coast League start that summer, he noticed his jack-hammering heart and quivering legs.

Before the injury, Aden was truly a gun. Even after missing two games and playing sparingly in the three games since, Aden still ranks sixth in the nation in percentage of his team’s shots taken (37.3 percent).
Booms become busts because justifiable confidence becomes foolish optimism. So it was. Believing the world less risky, people took more risks. Investment banks and households increased their debt. Lending standards eroded, because borrowers' repayment prospects were thought to have improved. Regulators relaxed oversight, because markets seemed more stable and self-correcting. On the fringes, ethical standards frayed; criminality increased. The rest, as they say, is history.

We told Mrs. Linn that Mr. Mann was looking for her. They spoke by phone last week - a private conversation.
Some scientists believe that red wine, in moderate amounts, may improve vascular function and have a less harmful effect on blood pressure than other forms of alcohol -- maybe even a positive effect. But this was not supported by a 2005 study that found red wine and beer increased systolic blood pressure by about the same amount.
What struck me was the caliber of the players who showed up Monday to support their teammate and a good cause. There were quarterback Joe Flacco and running back Ray Rice, two young faces of the franchise who are engaged in contract talks with the team, chatting with fans. There was cornerback Lardarius Webb, who recently signed a $50 million extension, posing for pictures.

The three major candidates should agree to raising and spending the same amount of money, say, $75,000 per week for the remaining three weeks of this primary campaign. Hopefully, they then wouldn't have to turn to those special interests with a financial stake in government spending. Certainly they wouldn't be so desperate for funding.

But Jeff Spring of the Auto Club noted that if the economy improves, the price increases may not affect the number of people who travel. They'll grin and bear it or trim the length of their trip.

To show his gratitude, Monroe brings her a bouquet of flowers at the spice shop. "I know it's not equal trade for my life, but I just wanted to say I'm glad you know how to clock a dude with a brick." Awww -- that Monroe really knows the way to a lady fuchsbau's heart.

You can order a combination platter if you want to try several different things, or choose from the appetizers, entrees, side dishes and about eight homemade desserts. Prices are extremely reasonable, there's a depth of flavor in every bite and even the falafel ($7) is a surprise. Instead of the usual deep-fried brown brick, it's a large, quickly fried round ball with a light, soft green, ground chick pea and fava bean center seasoned with fresh herbs. Same with the kibbi ($7). I'm used to an over-baked ball of lamb and cracked bulghur wheat, but Hage's is shaped like slices of meat loaf, loaded with sautéed onions and pine nuts and served with fresh yogurt and cucumbers. Delicious.
