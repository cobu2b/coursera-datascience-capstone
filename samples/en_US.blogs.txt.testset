Wood Flower by Kaiser crafts: B34, V06. Since this wasn't made of bits of ground-up wood like the tag it absorbed the color different. The marker dyes flowed more with the grain of the wood, while the other piece stayed fairly crisp and clean.
Aside from a busy series of readings for clients, I found time to chat with my friends and fellow exhibitors. One of these was Ted Royle from FisH. He operates a new kind of energy healing routine that is transformational, energetic and dynamic. Ted combines science with higher powers to unlock our secret selves and help us to heal from the mind through the body, and outward to our immediate environment.
Occasionally, and gratifyingly, I receive comments on posts written a while ago - such was the case a few days ago when I found this personal reminiscence of Henry McIlhenny on a post from November 2010. Coincidentally, more or less, in one of those rare moments when focus didn't cause peripheral blindness, I had found pictures of Mr McIlhenny's Glenveagh Castle in County Donegal when I was in the library looking for something else.

I don't blame the hospitals - obviously there is a huge cost factor. But you have to think of the health of the patients as well don't you?? They are all there because they are not that well, so being fed food and beverages in plastic that leaches Bisphenol-A really can't be helping their health.
All the people agreed. From that day until now the chief Chinamora is appointed from three houses, Chinamaringa, Chidziva and Nzvere.

For my book Sugar Daddy, I chose some Duran Duran, Depeche, as well as modern day hip-hop music because the story features a young gay man looking for the love of an older one.

One hundred and fifty years from now, Africa has become the world’s dominant technological and economic power. Crime, war, disease and poverty have been eliminated. The Moon and Mars are settled, and colonies stretch all the way out to the edge of the solar system. And Ocular, the largest scientific instrument in history, is about to make an epochal discovery…
After our hike we stopped for lunch and then hit the road. We had just gotten into the Phoenix city limits when Athletica realized she didn’t have her purse. I pulled into a gas station parking lot and we searched for it. No, it wasn’t there. I called the restaurant in Sedona and sure enough they had it. I put some more gas into the car and turned north back onto the I-17. We headed back to Sedona. The staff recognized us from a few hours earlier. We decided to stay for some warm sopapillas and honey before heading home. We ended up missing the Superbowl and all the illustrious commercials but all in all, I would not have changed a single thing about this past weekend. When we left Sedona, the almost full moon illuminated the giant rocks below. There is no show that can compare. The adventure continues.

So the Tea Party Mascot is “palling around with Black Nobility, Bloodline Sun-Worshipping Satanists”…the entire McGinniss Fence/Belmont Race Track Boob Flashing saga is just another Annual Bilderberg Conference distraction, and it’s highly possible she blew into town to participate in the Black Nobility June Satanic Rites & Rituals! Last summer it was “death panels” and the faux Letterman feud. Next stop for the Global Management Team…the Annual Summer PEDO-fest at Bohemian Grove in California …wonder will ole Henry K sneak any of the MK’d Palin women onto the 2,700 forest campsite for the usual antics of w/ their BETA Sex Kitten alters prog’md for ANYTHING, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE w/ANYONE FUN? According to Brice Taylor in “Thanks For The Memories” Grove members just love playing “The Most Dangerous Game” — getting high, hunting naked MK’s (adults and children) in the California forest w/rifles, catching and brutally raping them…

I wanted a fun activity for the end of the week and I really LOVE using visual arts to teach maths and to satisfy the curriculum outcomes. I was thinking of doing a guided drawing lesson using a character from a picture book, like the lesson I posted about here, but after some convincing from my own girls, we went with an Angry Birds theme!

We're down to two and a half weeks left of school. I am really looking forward to summer break. I'll still have to work to get things ready for next year, but at least I won't have to be in everyday.
In fact, the paper almost feels brittle, as if the corner is going to snap off when I turn the page. It doesn't, of course, but it feels like it could. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it's enough for me not to enjoy it. Every time I turn a page I think they could have used a roll of this stuff to test Grasshopper's stealth in Kung Fu:

What we do know is that hospitalizations for eating disorders in kids under 12 are up 119%, and research from the University of Minnesota found that weight control behaviors used by adolescents predicted significant weight gain in some kids and eating disorders in some kids but failed to produce thinner kids or healthier kids.
When news broke that the Petrino passenger (Jessica Dorrell) had been promoted to work in the football office just a week or so before the accident that set this mess in motion, it was clear that Petrino had likely sealed his fate with the Razorbacks. Say what you want about “morality clauses” (the mere idea of which in big time sports at any level amuse me a little bit), but Human Resources rules trump all, and at that point Petrino ran afoul of every Human Resources rule put in place since the Clarence Thomas hearings.
As we carry our precious cargo home enthusiastic sharing ensues. Ideas about egg dishes, soups, salads, savory meats rubbed with herbs are cheerily blurted. Senses stimulated with the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes of the edibles enrich our food experience even as they will soon invigorate our bodies.
Husain and Hedges also discuss how they became involved in the Occupy protests. Husain is a former corporate lawyer who was working on Wall Street when he decided to leave his position of privilege. Hedges went from being a New York Times reporter to getting arrested in front of Goldman Sachs and challenging the legality of the Authorization for Use of Military Force as embedded in the latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act signed by President Obama.

Signups for Fusion Beads' spring classes started Thursday. I stopped by Saturday to sign up for Marilyn Moore's Egg Basket: Oval Twined Wire Bowl, but got caught by their in-store sale. Most of their strands of shaped glass beads are 40-50% off through the end of the year, youza! I definitely failed my willpower roll and left the store with a lovely packet of beads, perfect for more lacework bracelets and accent beads in my freeform peyote. I did not sign up for the class - now I'll have to wait until after the holidays and hope there's still space. Keeping my fingers crossed.

The Canadian suffers from a rare lung and heart condition – pulmonary embolism. He has previously undergone two open-heart operations at the Ottawa Heart Institute and he requires constant medication. Around the time of arrest, his supply of medication, which he had brought from Canada, ran out. He has been without treatment for nearly four months now.
Instead I’m annoyed that I see so few examples of FAAB gender-queer folk like myself that are not able to adopt a more masculinized/androgynous appearance in places set up to be welcoming to us. I realize that probably has more to do with how US culture frames body types and gender and what boxes we are all constrained within because of it, so no, I’m not mad at the spaces themselves but more the framework we are all stuck to. If parts of that framework fit you and work for you and ease your pain, that’s wonderful. I’m very happy for you because I do have an idea of what its like to be trying to be something you aren’t. I just don’t fit there, and I’m getting tired of trying to find the next best thing because its still the wrong thing. Its like trying to sleep with sand in my bed.

On the international economic front, the situation on euro area markets improved somewhat compared with the stress peaks experienced in the closing months of 2011. Here, the ECB’s conventional and non-conventional monetary policy measures contributed notably, as did the approval of the second bail-out programme for Greece following the restructuring of its debt in private hands and the progress in the ongoing reform of economic governance in the euro area. However, instability returned in the opening days of April, affecting Spain and Italy acutely owing to the doubts arising over the adjustment processes under way in both countries.
I’m really loving using lime as the primary flavor enhancer. It wakes up produce (and the palate) without having to resort to sugar or salt. Better still, it makes me feel refreshed rather than deprived. This morning lime juice was the supporting player in a parfait reinterpretation of fruit salad. An award-winning performance, I’d say, enough so that I expect to repeat it as soon as tomorrow.
For Carver fans, Altman doesn't render a faithful adaptation but merely uses the writer as a launching pad for this incredible work. The story that most closely resembles its Carver origins is the one based on "A Small, Good Thing," but the quick intercutting of the various tales slightly undermines its emotional payoff in the film. However, only readers of the story will probably notice.

Tammie, thank you for paying attention to my drawings and paintings. Thank you for reading my words. Thank you for your encouragement. Thank you for gifting me prints of your magnificent snowflakes. Thank you for thinking of me when you drew this. Thank you for your words of comfort during my sad times. Thank you for being kind to me when I was mourning the loss of my sister Leah. Just thank you for being you, beautiful, wonderful, artistic and absolutely fabulous. Thank you.
And my other tip, learned in the recent workshop I took and wrote about here is to use a big jar for rinsing brushes during painting, filled with hot water. It dissolves the paint much faster and more thoroughly.
They were terribly sorry,
I did manage to do everything on yesterday's list with the exception of find title for car, but I'm pretty sure I know where it is, and I wrote 347 words (I had to leave to pick the boy up from school), so all in all not too bad.

:: Church Membership :: We officially became members of our church, Grace Presbyterian in Yorba Linda. It has taken us a few years to find a church that we really feel comfortable with and that also shares the same doctrinal values. We are very blessed to say the least.
Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.
We're in the final few days of the Landscape Futures Super-Workshop now, heading out soon for another field trip this afternoon, after half a week of presentations, lectures, site visits, crits, walks, and much else besides.
Rather than protest the extravagance, California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris instead has sued San Diego because she thinks transit was not favored enough in the plan and thereby violates the legislative planning requirements enacted in 2006 and 2008. Her predecessor (Jerry Brown, who is now the governor) similarly sued San Bernardino County in 2007.

Having lived in different regions of the country and sojourned in different English-speaking countries, I've long had a keen ear for differences in accent and pronunciation as well as word choice and syntax. I used to make a game of trying to guess the origin of an English-speaking person, but now it will be harder to do so, if accents keep being replaced by ''mass media English''.

I believe that we are living in a divided nation and this division is creating stress on everyone, as what was once common decency and mutual respect for differing opinions, has become a mud-slinging, gutter sniping, public evisceration of “gotcha” politics.

So, I’m going to read it. I want to try to figure out why it has become so big and if it’s worthy of the hype. And it’s only book one of an erotic trilogy. I wonder if they will make these books into a film franchise to rival Twilight? Umm … maybe not a franchise for teens.
Entry #42
Just the worry of making sure a model would show up on time is tiring! I always have a moment after Alicia finishes up the makeup and hair, where I briefly freak out and say an inner, resounding "Don't fuck this up". Because at that point it's its really just up to me to prove to this model that she didn't waste her time driving over here on her day off. I feel like adding that bit of pressure is a good thing. Creative people thrive under pressure. So i woke up on Friday morning completely exhausted, having that oh-god-why-did-I-do-so-many-jobs-in-a-row-I'm-in-so-much-pain-right-now feeling. But I chugged some dayquil, took a couple pain pills and pushed through my last shoot at Griffith park. I was so sore, which made me realize that I do some strange poses when snapping shots. I'm flat on the ground, I'm hoping up on tables, I'm one legged against a wall. I must look very silly, but hey it gets the job done. I came back home on Saturday, feeling sick and I totally puked a couple times from exhaustion. hahah.. But everything went fairly smoothly.

Coming to know means "to place oneself in a conditional relation to something"; to feel oneself conditioned by something and oneself to condition it--it is therefore under all circumstances establishing, denoting, and making-conscious of conditions (not forthcoming entities, things, what is "in-itself").
Both. I wish I didn’t have to sleep. I try to wring every last minute out of the day.
Now, we’ve moved on to medium. We just bought Pampers and Moony today, so we’ll see how they work. One thing’s for certain, the medium fits much better than the small. Pampers fits extremely well, and my wife said that she’s probably a Pampers baby, meaning she’s the right shape for them. The Moony diapers have an advantage, though. They have an elastic waste band. We’ll see how both brands hold up to leaks, and if they hold enough volume of poop.

When security people say they're going to search your bag, they have a different meaning of the word "search" from the one my husband uses when he says he's going to search for the correct place to put the kitchen sieve. Very different. Their version of search involves them taking everything out of my bag, and then everything out of everything that's in my bag. Now I, being a bit of a control freak and an ex-girl guide (see Of boots, escalators and photographers) tend to have some weird things in my bag when I'm away doing school talks. Even weirder than plastic brains. To be honest I'd prefer not to say some of the things that I had in my bag but if you were one of my fellow passengers, you would know. And you would be laughing. As they were.

How do we come to understand things? Understanding is cumulative. As a child I understood what love is. At least I believed I did. I loved and I was loved. I understood what that felt like. Only now I’m in my fifties can I accept that my definition required significant adjustment and I’m still not sure I’m happy with how I define love. The same goes for loss. I’ve lost pets, acquaintances, one friend that I know of, both parents but I haven’t – and hope I never do – lose my daughter. I’ve misplaced her but she was never lost to me. So I don’t understand what Thomése went through. And I never want to. I do understand his need to understand and why he would turn to words to help him. That is what appealed to me about this book: his struggle with language.
There are alternatives to FC. FC is never ethical to use if protecting the rights of the individual is your primary goal. Our most vulnerable deserve our very best. They don't deserve shortcuts that put words and abilities onto them that are not them; it is a devaluing of who they are to say what they are capable of is not good enough.
Ah god, I got it. I rode on the right bus but to opposite direction. The place I wanted to go was at the opposite of this bus route. Terribly, 1 hour trip became 3 hours, and in this horrible roller coster. Say no more!!
Let me once again make the case for seeding hedge funds in this environment. There are many frustrated prop traders at big banks and brokerage firms that see the writing on the wall as Basel III rules come into effect. They want out of these shops because most of them are sick and tired of the bullshit politics, and I don't blame them.
Thank You, God, for giving me the morning back.
Bottom Line: $22 is not exactly cheap for a bottle of nail polish. However, Dior has a nice range of unique shades to choose from and the formula is quite stellar. If you are on a budget, definitely check out Exquix. For those looking to splurge, this holiday collection is a great place to start.
I’d like to think I’m a good script writer, but I think there made better when I have REAL performers like Alex and Daisy performing them as opposed to people on my course.

All in all, a fun and relaxing weekend. I’d intended to do some work on the old bike but the weather was WAY too nice here to stay cooped up in a garage, so decided to ride instead. Right now I’m propped up on the couch with my laptop, watching the Dude play “Elder Scrolls: Skyrim” and trying to find the nerve to start writing again. Yup folks, this post is a handy-dandy procrastination tool and I shall wield it proudly within my golden grasp. Fear my procrastinating skills for they are LEGION!!!

Perhaps the best description I can think of for Anvil! is that it’s a cross between This is Spinal Tap and American Movie. But while there are plenty of laughs in Anvil! - some of which the subjects are probably unaware of – the movie is more about struggle and dedication, and less about laughing at talentless, self-deluded hacks. Steve “Lips” Kudlow and Robb Reiner, the heart and soul of the metal band Anvil, have been at it for 30 years, with one big flashpoint in the early 80’s and a lot of playing at sports bars and in European dungeons for ten or twelve people a show. Though they occasionally show signs of giving up the rock n’ roll dream, they remain committed to staying together, making music, and hoping for that big break.
Then comply with the job to see how things are being done. Remember that lots of small, earlier course modifications are easier than later, larger course modifications.

Crispy, golden, fried pizza dough, salty olives and capers, ooey-gooey melty cheese, zingy tomato sauce and a bit of spinach to let you think you're eating something healthy. Each panzarotti is like a little present you get to open with your mouth. And since the recipe makes about a dozen, it's the best kind of gift - the kind you get to share with others. Thanks to Nadia G. for sharing these with us.

In bringing these terms together highlighting “augmentation” and “space” Manovich aptly captured and synthesized two convergent digital developments: mobile / wireless / locative media and Augmented Reality. But this is only one side of the story he’s telling us in this essay; an important part of it consists of an original reading of the history of visual arts as a history of expanding its display platforms from the gallery wall to the gallery space (installation art) to information space (interactive art), followed by diverse case studies of contemporary art, architecture, and urban design, ranging from Janet Cardiff’s audio walks to diverse manifestations of the “electronic vernacular” including DigitalSky in Hongkong, Robert Venturi’s “information surfaces” and Rem Koolhaas’ NY Prada Store. These examples allow Manovich to recast augmentation from a purely technological definition to augmentation as a theoretical concept and as a cultural and aesthetic practice.
Adaptability to new electronic worlds is all very well, but it is nothing without a streak of hard conservatism. As writers we love neologisms, word play and the whole dazzling funfair of language as she is spoke and bespoke, but we also have a certain interest in stability. We would prefer a word at the end of a paragraph to retain much the same bundle of meanings that it had when it appeared at the beginning of it. We know about the modifications of meaning undergone by any word on its journey through text, and as writers it is our business to know that, but we do rely on the stability of the range.

The first indisputable contemporary evidence found during this study of Foster's commercial artistic activity is an advertisement that he placed in The Leeds Mercury of 17 June 1809. The words "By His Majesty's Royal Letters Patent" suggest that a Royal patent had been granted for the newly invented machine for sketching profiles in a short space of time, accurately and in great detail, although Foster in this particular case neither implicitly states that he was the inventor of the machine nor the grantee of the patent.
Our experience with the Japanese during the war was also a shared experience. Both city’s were ravaged by the cruel occupation. One could find very beautiful memorials dedicated to the heroes and victims of the war around downtown. The strategical location of Manila and Singapur were ideal for just about everything, including serving as military bases for invading armies. I’m hoping to find a good book about WWII events here in Singapore.

I started making them because I was really tired of going to the gaming store and only finding dice bags that would tip over and had a fabric selection that I just didn’t find appealing. I know gamers like to personalize things, and I knew I could make something to serve that interest. This is why I also do custom orders. I just love it when I get a custom order bang on. There’s nothing better than knowing there’s a happy geek in the world because of you.

I will still be helping parents include art, handicrafts and nature study in their homeschool...but the look of Hearts and Trees is going to change. :)
Take care, hope to hear from you soon.

If you’re anything like me then you will agree that wearing makeup all day can make your face feel dirty and weighed down. All too often though we are too tired and lazy to take our makeup off, thus causing breakouts and clogged pores. Of course a majority of girls won’t admit to this, but hey… I will! Noxzema is a brand that seems almost n0n-existent to the beauty world, but I’ve been using this facial cleanser ever since I was a tween. Soaps are too harsh and getting out your daily soapy face wash is just… too much work haha. Well, I’ve got a solution for you that will make your face feel amazing and it will only take 30 seconds of your time. Good bye dirt, oil, and makeup!
At the end of our trail, everyone was ready for a snack and to head back home. The perfect day trip on our Spring Break!

Now we are going crazy about getting tickets. You won't find any information about how and where you can get tickets for this concert. The only thing we know is they will hold the concert at Tempodrom in Berlin. So we have to wait for new information. I think I will go crazy while waiting for the tickets will be sold. x_x
On Sunday morning at 8, before breakfast, we joined the friars for 'les laudes' - a short service of chanted hymns and psalms. It was magical. The church is a vast and resonant concrete cavern. Perhaps 18m high, around 40m long and 10m wide. The four sheer walls connected by the strata lines where the concrete was poured layer after layer. Bright coloured light filters through horizontal slits - these slope upwards through the massive walls, so that the window itself is not visible, just the painted surface inside the opening that reflects the light. The chanting of the seven friars filled the space completely. We tried to imagine how it must have sounded when there were 70 or 80 of them. It is a space that I found slightly oppressive initially - the concrete is almost overwhelming, the geometry of the space, particularly the north end, is not entirely comfortable - but when the friars sing it all makes sense. The volume, the material and the voices just work together.
I hope we'll be able to see these interviews and the filmed Betty MacDonald interview at the next Betty MacDonald Fan Club meeting.
While soaking up the golden age of art cinema, Despins and Dumaresq started talking about their own artistic ambitions. Despins credits his friend with giving him the necessary encouragement: “I was teaching mathematics at the time. I quit that job, the school was a terrible place, and started working in the evenings. Bill was the one who suggested I should go take a film course. I went for an interview with the London Film School, and got on that course. I don't know if I would have done that had Bill not said, why don't you do a film course? So I was working nights, teaching somewhere, and did this film course that took about eight months to a year. I was still at there in 1964 when Bill and I started work on something he had written called ‘The Slain Girl’. By that time I was living in a flat in Paddington, and had a child. We took over my sitting room for a long time preparing this film. I lit the scenes, the whole thing was going to be done in that room. We didn't finish it, but that was the first thing we did together. I remember putting it on at the London Film School and the person teaching camera said the lighting looked alright. It was based on a poem of Bill's. I would do the lighting, set up the shot, then show it to Bill and see if it was alright with him.”

Ok, I killed enough time before meeting my friend at his office. He invited me to a meet and greet lunch at the swank Nashville City Club. Well, it’s swank if you consider early 70s decor to be swank. It is a private dinner club in a Nashville penthouse and has been the location of a lot of moving and shaking for decades. However, I get the feeling that it is struggling to maintain its grandeur.

This blog isn't a 101 site. So for those just discovering unschooling, I've created an Unschooling 101 + Comment Policy page (see it right there at the top right, easily visible to everyone who stumbles upon this blog?)! I've attempted to cover all of the most common initial reactions/thoughts people tend to express, as well as making it clear what type of comments will not be accepted on this blog. I hope this will serve as a good primer to those just discovering unschooling, as well as hopefully cut down on some negative comments on this blog!

Well, there's a band called HORRID that plays Swedish death metal since 1990. Maybe they have never written a true masterpiece but they've stayed true since the beginning, and they're still active. Then we have ERODED (not to be confused with the German ERODED), which are really great. Their only two demos have been reprinted on CD and they're currently preparing a full-length record. PROFANAL must be mentioned as well, they're sweadeath-like and Dark Descent itself has just released their brand new split 7"! Furthermore, there are of course other killer, non-swedeath bands out there in Italy, but the main problem is not the lack of bands. The problem is, indeed, the organization and support a scene should have to be healthy.
My little school threw benefit horse shows each spring to raise money for our sports program before insurance forbade public fun and diving boards. In addition to allowing horses on our soccer field, we had a Jack Russell terrier as a school mascot. “Bandit” hung out in our classrooms in the days prior to chronic animal dander allergies. Childhood had more dog hair and philosophical potential before humans developed an intolerance for the same lead paint I used to nibble from my crib slats. I personally believe all the fun stopped when that douche with the coffee burns sued McDonald’s and won. Liability has certainly taken the kick out of kids’ memories these days. We’ve all turned into, like, total pussies.
Well this morning I got up and did a walk only because I was forced to. I walked from my house this to Marsh. I went to get me 10- 32 oz bottles of Gatorade, and 2 packs of Yogurt. I carried that shit back home because I refused to let a petty fuck bring me down. MF think I need him, but he need to realize that I don’t. MF did all that complaining about me being over my Grandmother’s house and he was lonely, but the MF ain’t did shit or made shit any easier for my healing process. This MF had the nerve to wake up talking about someone sending me some pictures of them, then wanna claim he had a cramp… I’m cool…I hope he is fucking around on me…shit I’m not having sex so I’m coo..I can’t have the sex that I want anyways so it’s not like I’m burning any damn calories having boring unexciting sex…either I’m on top or him…So oh well
After our visit, we had a final lunch with Patty. She was an outstanding trip leader and did a great job keeping everything organized.

"Move it... lazy girl" he said giving me a hard smack on my behind and a cause to start a pretend fight.
I first became acquainted with this problem through the Regretsy website, where people often poke fun at really shitty craft projects and “Steampunk” crap being sold on Etsy. According to the offended crafters and thin-skinned wieners everywhere, having a negative opinion about something automatically makes one a fat, jealous loser. And probably also a cat lady. And a virgin. Maybe a lesbian, too, it really just depends on the offended party. No no, my personal opinion that your craft project sucks cannot possibly be based on the fact that your craft project does indeed suck. I only think your craft project sucks because I’m so fat and jealous of your craft-making abilities that, naturally, the only way to cope with that jealousy is to insult something that is actually really really awesome.
And I also got to meet my new 'granddaughter' in the form of a Jack Russell mix.
Meyer was arrested for apparently being drunk in public and was put into the cells with eight other people. Van Wyk said it seemed Meyer had an argument and a fight broke out. Meyer died soon after from his injuries. Ntabazalila said no weapons were used in the fight. – Sapa

Currently in the pickle rest two lichen brooches for my Nature & Culture class, surrounding me sit multiple dream drawings for my Drawing class, and at school there is the structure of a hollow box in my locker in the metals studio, for my Digital Tools for Artists class. And, in my backpack sit my flashcards for Art History, waiting to be drilled into my memory.

Notice the lagoon that separates the west side of the island from the east. On the west side sits a studio home and a guest cabana with an electric generator. The east side is undeveloped. Marina and airstrip are a 15-minute boat ride away, on the main island of Abacos.
I certainly was not going to help him push the button, or push him across the street, because I have helped old people before, and they will fuck you over every time. I just know that if I had helped him cross the street, he would have wanted me to continue pushing him the four miles uphill to get him back to the place he rolled out of. What am I, a gift? I don't think so. If there is one thing my readers know (all 3 of them, I can hear you out there, breathing) it is that I am no fucking Girl Scout. Girl Scouts put advisories on their cookie boxes to warn other people about people like me.

Since Alli and I read many of the same blogs: I can only list a few blogs that she didn't list herself. As well, I don't read a lot of blogs, but enjoy staying with the same ones day in and day out. I feel like these are my friends even though we have never met.
The other guests were an astounding roster of MOR pop people from different eras, all phoning in — Morgan’s show will have none of the wonderful (and eminently watchable) circus-like aspect of King’s show, where everyone talked at once on separate satellite feeds. Thus, Donny Osmond was heard at one point, Paul Anka at another, Gloria Estefan at another, and a member of the Commodores and another gent from a Nineties black boy band to

”We let a lot of houses fall in,” Dr. Pilkey said. ”I’m proud of that.” But houses threatened here and there are not the truest test of whether a state’s politicians can withstand pressure for stabilization, he said.

White Town: Undressed
So when one of my girls started asking to put on shoes first thing in the morning, I knew who she got it from. Kayla, would wake up, and go into her twin sister’s closet and pick out a new pair every day, her own shoes are stacked up too high for her to reach.
On the wall above it, is my most favourite piece of delft blue ware, the Dutch coffee grinder. To the right on the bench I keep the salt pot, a container with a brush I use for dipping in oil and a spoon rest, again all in Delft blue. It was a hobby of mine to get things to go into my "Dutch" kitchen and follow the blue theme which took a quite some time over the last 10 years before we went on the pension. I'm glad I did now, as this is the part of the house we spend most of our time and it has become a comfortable place to work in amongst my little treasures. It's not a big kitchen but very functional and I love being in there."
I got in around 10AM, and left around 12:15PM or so.

Or, so it seams at times.
The lower walls are fifteen feet, built with an angle tower by the McCarthys of Muskerry. It was subsequently occupied at one time by Cormac McCarthy, King of Munster, who is said to have supplied four thousand men from Munster to supplement the forces of Robert the Bruce at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Legend has it that the latter king gave half of the Stone of Scone to McCarthy in gratitude. This, now known as the Blarney Stone, was incorporated in the battlements where it can now be kissed.
Needless to say, the truck with a couple of tons on its back could not reverse out of the field - a neighbour came along with his tiny tractor - the truck did not move - only leaned on another neighbours' wall .
Specifying the address down to the number of the house and the block on which is stands, the bird enabled police to track down its 64-year-old owner.
Embracing life like a fairy tale enables us to recapture a child-like sense of astonishment. It helps us to remember that this world, though fallen, is indeed an amazing and wondrous place. The fairy tale mindset makes us grateful, because it reminds us that all the beauty of this world is an undeserved gift. The story is precious because it might have been told quite differently. God did not need to write our character into his world, but he chose to. Like a fairy tale, this world is often hostile as well as beautiful; however, God’s word assures us that our adventures in this world are not in vain, and that there is an even greater adventure yet to come.
Well, the tides turned when this friendly neighbor lost his house to foreclosure. I wish that on no one, but there are consequences to your actions, and he didn’t lose the house to downsizing or a failing economic system. He lost it due to his own erratic and irresponsible behavior. Losing his house wasn’t a shock to us, but what was a shock is how he moved out. He just left. And not only did he leave behind a crap hole for the bank to deal with, he left behind the horse and the two dogs trapped in a pen with no food or hay or water.
I reached the hotel, checked in and made it to my room. I consumed my delicious McDonald's dinner while flipping channels on the TV and trying to get connected to their wi-fi. It was about 8:30 now, and it was still coming down outside.
Time is growing short and the stakes are getting higher. For the Queen of the Mists has her own agenda, and there are more players in this game than Toby can guess. With everything on the line, she will have to take the ultimate risk to save herself and the people she loves most—because if she can’t find the missing pieces of the puzzle in time, Toby will be forced to make the one choice she thought she’d never have to face again…
This is M11 Rickshaw. It went together amazingly well by strip piecing it. Granted it is ever so slightly different than Jane’s original as the points of the sideways and regular diamonds don’t match exactly. The angles on my diamonds are just slightly larger. But it’s close enough for me, and this was just easier. Here’s what I did.

The reasons and who is to blame for all this chaos is all subjective. It is up to Ice Hockey UK to handle everything to do with the national team. From media and press to training camps and accommodation it is their responsibility. But surely they can only work with what they given. Meaning that the EIHL’s season ended a week later than the previous year and so players were only released to the national team 6 days before the opening day of the World Championships. The EPL, who provided the coach, back up goalie and a centre, only ended their season on the opening day of the championships.
Granted early Christians were libelled repeatedly and not taken seriously by educated (and uneducated) Romans, but I think Tertullian is reacting with something other than love when he imagines his persecutors’ futures.

As a child living in the islands finding coral on the beach was my weekly goal. Forays in glass bottom boats to see coral and sea creatures such as urchins and sting rays was always on top of my list to things to do. I was never bored by going over and over, as the sea is forever changing.

I have also met some of the people with whom your sister is working, including two mothers who lost their daughters to adoption, one in a so called “open adoption.” I guess the fact that you lost your son to adoption puts you in the same category as these women. OH! THAT’S RIGHT! You still had him with you, didn’t you? I guess that REMOVES you from that category.
The people in the coach behind us were also at the rally in Winston Salem and have lived here as full time RV'ers. She told me more about Pham, who calls the local cops if he suspects the strangest thing from the residents of the mobile home park on the hill. She says Pham is one in a million and I have already seen that. They sold their home near here and travel between Durham where one son lives and their other son in southern CA and visit family in FL along the way. Her husband is a retired computer program mer and says he picks up odd jobs along their travels to supplement their retirement. She has had medical issues about which she did not elaborate and says she is bound to enjoy life while she has it and do things while she can. Good advice.
"We therefore believe this legislation will assist in combating both copper and property crimes," Mthethwa said.
Scott quotes Zbigniew Brzezinski:
During an inspection last year, the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement found 44 guests in the house, inadequate smoke alarms and other unsafe conditions, problems the city says are common when residences are used for short-term lodging.
As he walked out of the city, Khan, giving a sense of the place, said the once bustling town was “like a graveyard”. The silence was broken only by the “barking of stray dogs and the braying of some donkeys”.

Lord Millner published his report in February 1921, in which he recommended the end of the Egyptian Protectorate. A year later, on 22nd February 1922, the British Government issued a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence; although they would continue to protect their interests with regard to the Suez Canal. On 15th March, Fouad proclaimed himself King of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur.

As I said, it all comes down to perspective. What is important to you? Better yet, what is going to be important to you one million years from today? Remember, there will come a day when things that you highly valued will suddenly become worthless. And things that you didn’t care about will suddenly become of supreme importance.

Let people live and be happy....after all, the original definition of gay was just that.
These were the things almost all of them said they wished to do once all their life desires were fulfilled. And when asked why, all of them said mostly because they always wanted to do these things but are too busy fulfilling their dreams and desires. And they also said that if they do these things listed above, they will bring more meaning to their lives and feel they have accomplished something and make themselves worthwhile and meaningful. By doing these, it will bring them lot of happiness and peace.

What strikes me as super strange about this film first off is the notion that a bunch of birds and laddies on motorbikes can ride through workaday British shoppers and harass the locals and only one bobby e'er shows up to stop 'em. Special note to bakery delivery guys: don't try to walk across the lane with a stack of freshly baked bread while bikers are roaring their engines around, terrorizing the populace right outside your shop. And if you're up on a ladder in the middle of the lane, get down! Then again, reality is not high on the menu in PSYCHOMANIA. Instead it flatters the palate of the sugar-addicted adolescent, making up in vandalism and chipper death cult romance what it lacks in meat, fiber, and coherence.

Is it me? I sometimes don't quite follow the Author, Author pieces in Saturday's Guardian Review, those articles in which authors talk about their own take on the writing process. Maybe it's something to do with the essentially idiosyncratic nature of the writing process for each writer: either those authors are talking to themselves in their own private language, using their own private short-cut associations, or I'm so caught up in my own that I can't always relate to the whole of their arguments. On Saturday Adam Thirwell wrote about the difficulty of representing thoughts and psychology truthfully in novels, but if you can sort out the difference between the description in the first paragraph here and the intimate third person, or between the two modes in the two separate paragraphs, then you're brighter (or more patient, or less hung up on your own writing obsessions) than I:In an essay, I once wrote about how Franz Kafka invented a strange style in his novels about this man he called K: where, although it looks like a third-person narrative, it is in fact a disguised first-person narrative, belonging to K. And suddenly I thought that I understood more precisely why Kafka wanted to do this. It was a way of inventing a subterfuge, so that he could be true to the cloudiness of thoughts. In a diary entry, on January 12 1911, Kafka noted how he hadn't been writing much, partly because he was lazy, true, but also "because of the fear of betraying my self-perception". Because, he continued, if a thought cannot be written down "with the greatest completeness, with the incidental consequences, as well as with entire truthfulness" - which it couldn't - then what was written down would replace the vague thought "in such a way that the real feeling will disappear while the worthlessness of what has been noted down will be recognised too late". This is why Kafka needed to write in the third person, while really describing the personal contours of a character's thoughts: it was a way of outwitting the imprecise solidity of language.
I never posted about my Thanksgiving baking creation. I made Libby's Sour Cream Pumpkin Bundt Cake. It was....ehhhhhh. Unremarkable. Probably because (a) the taste was reminiscent of a spice cake I ate for my last breakfast in Israel when I was 12 1/2, which I promptly threw up due to airsickness from Tel Aviv to Heathrow to New York...as in I THREW UP FOR THE ENTIRETY OF BOTH FLIGHTS, and (b) it did not look like the picture! The streusel sank to the bottom (rose to the top when I flipped it over), so it did not have that tunnel o'streusel taste I was hoping for.

When the color is how you want it to be, bust out the brush and paint the tea onto the wood. If you added the steel wool, you can also use that as your brush, but I'd recommend putting on gloves first. The stain will absorb pretty quickly and you probably won't need to wipe off any excess. (I didn't.) You can apply more than one coat.

Tasting Note: Pinotage. 13.5% ABV. Color is dark purple. Nose is jam, vanilla, and some chocolate. Plums and berries, with some wood and spice, along with the vanilla. A lot going on, maybe too much, as it’s disjointed. A tick hot for me (at 13.5% it shouldn’t be, adding to the thought that this is disjointed), although the bright berry finish is pretty interesting. Not all that.

Yesterday we went on a field trip with our Unschoolers group. When we got back, the kids were antsy from being good for a prolonged period of time, so I turned them loose outside. It was only 50 degrees, but it was warm enough. They played in the front circle drive and literally (I kid not) climbed up and sat on top of the shed roof for like 2 hours.

With such finely crafted technical aspects, and a great supporting cast, it's understandable why Soderbergh would take a chance on an unknown property like Carano in the lead. Primarily known as an MMA fighter, Carano really brings it in the fight scenes and though her range is somewhat limited, Soderbergh tailors Haywire to her strengths. She doesn't quite have the charisma of some of her more seasoned co-stars, but she is believable as a special agent/ass-kicking-machine which is fairly rare in the subgenre of the female-centered action picture.

I was drawn to unschooling because it felt like a natural extension of attachment parenting. I felt like we had trusted our children from day one to become the people they needed to be. I also remember that we started this journey knowing that each child would be ready for the challenges of life in their own time and in their own way. Remembering these two things has helped me tremendously.

and I never gave it much thought until now.
I do this thing with clothes though, particularly pieces I'm especially fond of. I tend to attach a specific memory to them. Apparently this is not a recent development in my psyche, as my mother will tell you that I'm notorious for saying, whenever she mentions something that occurred years and years ago, "Oh, sure. I remember that day. I remember the outfit I was wearing, actually." This memory association isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course. I still look fondly at the sweater I wore through-out my backpacking days, ten years ago, and doubt I'll ever be able to get rid of the thing. I know which dresses I wore to friend's weddings, I recall certain outfits I wore on important events in my life - big, like job interviews, and small, like meeting a new friend for dinner, hoping we become as good of friends as I imagine we could be. Even when filling up a donation bag for Goodwill recently I had fond memories of the clothes I bid farewell to - the khaki shorts I wore while traveling in Costa Rica, the flannel shirt I'd worn up in Maine with friends, the one I'd accidentally shrunk in the wash once I returned to the city.

Except for that we didn’t hang out again for another month and that was basically when I set up a booty call. He’s talked to me once since then, and only when I texted him to ask him for advice for dieting. I was starting to do Muay Thai and MMA and knew that he was a trainer and a chef, so who better to ask? He gave me some pointers and asked what gym I was going to. I told him and that ended the conversation. 2 days later, who do I see at the gym? Yup, he’s there. And he pretends that I don’t even exist. Awesome. Now I look like a crazy psycho stalker, haha. Luckily, he’s only been there twice that I’ve been there in the past 3 or so months.

In Libya, riots against those living in the Jewish quarters occurred in Tripoli in January 1945. Sixty percent of Jewish possessions were destroyed and 135 people were killed; soldiers acted as accomplices to the rioters. Jews were forced to evacuate. Jews in Hara, Tripoli, and Benghazi were put on remand. In 1948, there were more riots. An eighty-four-year-old Jewish leader, Halfalla Nahum, was murdered in Tripoli in 1963; during the summer of that year, other Jewish figures were attacked and injured. In 1967, riots broke out and ten people were killed. In 1969, an anti-Semitic campaign was initiated against the Jews, and Jewish cemeteries were razed in 1970. Sixty-four synagogues were destroyed in 1978, and seventy-eight synagogues were transformed into mosques, or, in the case of Benghazi, into Coptic churches.

If it had been focused entirely on Lucas, this could have been a simple rise and fall of a gangster story, and it certainly does contain those elements, but adding Roberts story enhances it, giving us a bigger view of the world in the film as well as a great counterpoint between them. Both me work in well established systems according to their own terms, but frequently we find that there is little division between their two sides. Robert's fellow cops are as much a part of the drug problem as anyone Lucas works with. While it is based on a true story, I'm only looking at the world presented in the film and the characters as they appear in it. Certainly real world gangsters carrying movies is a long tradition and our awareness of figures like Al Capone, John Dillinger, among others has come from their film portrayals. Like those earlier gangsters, we know that the story isn't over until the gangster takes a fall. One remarkable feature about this film is that those earlier gangsters were public enemy number one, hounded by the FBI, but Frank Lucas' career coming to an end is different, rather than inevitable, it happens against the odds, as the system seemed happy to support him.

While the Municipal Art Society and others have suggested saving the historically valuable Ward Bakery on Pacific Street, the DEIS says it’s just not possible: “Demolition of the former LIRR Stables at 700 Atlantic Avenue and the former Ward Bread Bakery complex at 800 Pacific Street would be significant adverse impacts. The potential reuse of these properties as part of the proposed project has been studied, but it was concluded that there is no feasible or prudent alternative to demolishing them.”
We flew out on the Saturday, stayed in a luxurious hotel/apartment, went to the show that night at the Lyric Theatre - the show was fantastic - absolutely loved it and then we spent the morning in Sydney - went to mass at the biggest Cathedral in Australia and then grabbed a bite to eat before we flew home again. I also have to add that Sydney turned on the beautiful weather while we were there too. It was so nice to see the harbour glistening away.
It strikes me then that learning is relatively simple by comparison to the difficult business of unlearning and breaking the habits and conditioning of a lifetime!

To determine whether a song is a variation of another, it is first necessary to separate the lyrics from the underlying score. The lyrics may be in a different language and yet have complete originality even if they are a literal translation.
Surprise that special someone in your life by getting out of those flannel pajama pants and into something a bit more glamorous and feminine! Try an Olga Nightgown. They are glamorous, super comfortable, romantic and comfortable! Olga definitely knew a woman's body as she designed styles for her company. From the "Sleeping Pretty" line with built in bras, to the "Cuddle Top" which features a brushed nylon ultra soft flannel, there's a style for everyone from demure to dramatic.

When French colonials moved to Canada at the start of the 18th century they took their “Poque” with them. It then travelled further south to the New Orleans and spread at first all around Louisiana where it was played in the famous floating saloons and than later all over the country. One of the earliest contemporary mentions of poker happened in J Hildreth book “The Dragoon Campaigns to the Rocky Mountains” in 1836. The game of the time seemed to be a 20 card deck variation played with Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens which were divided between the players to make the best hand, there were no communal cards.

---My new friend Lauren has been in many of these photos with me cus she is the party queen. Always something happening in that girls plans so she's the one to know! She hosted a Soup Party at her parents home about 30 min away from the city and it was just a cozy night to be in a home with pumpkin and thanksgiving decorations, friends, lots of pots of soup, and games. Fun fall idea.

Eventually my husband and I figured out a system that alleviated much of the stress – well, at least the stress about who we saw when. But even this did not make that anticipation return.
The EU wants new legislation in place by 2016, resulting in the UK having to collect 45 tonnes of e-waste for every 100 tonnes of e-goods put on sale the three years previously. This law will only really affect retailers; however, it may lead to better deals for those looking to dispose of small electrical goods.

Early in my research, after I gathered many of my resources, I spent one weekend on photo research. It’s a great way to begin to “see” the people in the story. That’s when I discovered the photographs of Father Frank Browne, who was on board ship for the first 24 hours before departing with many rare pictures. As it turned out, I decided to begin the book with Father Browne.
Happy Spring!! We've been having some lovely warm weather in Montreal, Qc. Canada this week! I am thrilled of course! I hope you are experiencing good weather of your own too, and if not, well I have a challenge to brighten your day anyway!
It. Was. Awesome! This was my "era" that I missed. I am a very "peace, love & happiness" type person. Although I disagree with how the troops were treated in this era, I think we learned a lot from that mistake in general... and I LOVE the music of the time!

There is a song by the Talking Heads written in 1980 called Once in a Lifetime. I love this song, not only because it harkens to the nostalgia of my youth but because it has both odd and poignant lyrics. One line goes “you may ask yourself, well, how did I get here?”

It was not physical abuse, which I don’t condone. It was not even particularly dangerous, though parents who never let their kids out of their sight will argue otherwise. What it was was a dramatic gesture – a wigged out one, indeed – but I could see myself, some day, doing something just about as dramatic. One night I was so mad my tween-age son hadn’t taken out the garbage after being asked 18 times (at least) that I said, “I’m going to scream.” And then I did. Bloody murder.

Most do not realise it but the British public had been subject to a campaign of disinformation for a period of almost half a century. We have been lied to, repeatedly and deliberately for a variety of motives, none of which had anything to do with the best interests of you or your country . They lied to hide the fact that they were allowing the largest alien invasion of this country in our Island's history and in order to keep you placidly obedient whilst they changed our country beyond all recognition.
I had to be going the wrong way. They wouldn’t have sent me up a road like this without warning me about all the “No Trespassing” signs and making sure I had four-wheel drive, right? After crawling up the steep, washed-out road, I topped out on a ridge next to a junkyard in the middle of nowhere. The view of the Sangre de Cristo’s was phenomenal, but the house looked cobbled together with plywood and scrap metal roofing. There were at least ten cars and trucks on blocks, and I was ready to high-tail it out of there at first sign of trouble.
I am so excited that today I finally got to meet my "blogger" friend Diane of DK Designs in San Jose, CA. We have been following each other's blogs for months now, and she's in town this weekend to work on a wedding.

“The Sunday-evening after –meeting is another rare opportunity for evangelistic service, into which many pastors wisely press their Endeavorers. Dr. Charles M. Sheldon, as has been before stated, advocates making this great young people’s evangelistic service of the week for the actual bringing of men to a decision for Christ, and in his own experience has proved the vast usefulness of such a plan (p.330).
So long to afternoon naps spent with my book (Curtis Sittenfeld's American Wife - excellent) and a mug of tea.
It is by being conformed to the death of Christ, everyday, by the power of His resurrection, that we will gain Christ. What will the outcome of gaining Christ be? What will this special Prize be? It is the out-resurrection from among the dead. You see, everyone will be resurrected. Some will be resurrected to judgement. Some will be resurrected to glory. The out-resurrection, as the Greek states it, is something special for those who have gained Christ. It is for those who have been filled and saturated with His resurrection Life, having died to self. It is a special enjoyment of Christ in His coming 1,000 year reign.
I came across this article in The Hollywood Reported today titled, “Jeremy Lin Lunches With Fired ESPN Writer Who Wrote Alleged Racial Slur.” The article talks about the writer who was fired for “…Calling Lin’s poor play in the loss that ended his magical run ‘A Chink in the Armor.’ It was perceived as a racial slur about Lin’s Chinese heritage…”
Ali and I could talk about anything and everything. Hopes, fears, men, relationships, life. We eventually met in person and made plans and actually got to do a lot of things together. We did and we had a blast. Among the list is driving to Texas to get a tattoo because they were illegal at that time in Oklahoma.

“Virtousity”
At the back of all this is the person who really does have a day job. There are plenty of people who are teachers, farmers, accountants and so on who have a steady income and also write. But that doesn't mean their time is not valuable! They are writing instead of playing with their children, watching television, visiting friends. If a publisher intends to make money from that person's writing, they should pay a fair rate for it. Anything else is exploitation. Fiction is tricky - writers write at different rates. I write at different rates! I have written a book that has taken ten years and a book that has taken two hours. Of course a publisher can't pay an advance of £400,000 because it took you 10 years to write your novel. What is not acceptable is for a publisher who wants to produce (say) an A level guide to budget £400 for the author, knowing that it means someone with at least degree-level skills in that subject will have to work for less than £5 an hour to do it, even if they do have a 'day job' that pays the bills. It's less than the minimum wage.

Kirk is a young, rich brat who doesn’t think of anyone but himself. To celebrate his twenty-first birthday, Kirk throws a big birthday bash at his father’s huge ranch house. As Kirk celebrates, he takes sexually-enhanced drug the rich enjoy called, Alantica Dream. During the party, Kirks enjoys overindulging in the company of many men, relishing in the pleasure of having orgasm after orgasm from his so-called friends. One moment Kirk is enjoying the party and the next, he wakes up in a cage with a uniquely looking red-headed, freckled man. Since any blemish is considered a flaw, Kirk has never seen such a captivating looking man before and he’s immediately intrigued by him. Kirk soon finds out he and the man, Lyndarum, are both to be sold as slaves, and he’s both confused and angered by this. To his dismay, the men who captured him do not believe he is THE Kirk Skelling and they treat him like they would any ordinary slave. But there is something about Lyndarum’s sweet and sexy disposition that Kirk feels an immediate connection with, so he quickly decides to do what he must to keep them both safe. Together. Despite how dire their situation looks, Kirk is determined to get both him and Lyndarum safely away from their captors so they can share a life and love that Kirk never knew he wanted to have until he met Lyndarum. Will they be able to escape captivity and achieve a life and love that both men crave so desperately?
So why now, why leak this photo of Wood now? The Grassy Knoll Institute investigators believe they have uncovered the truth. Natalie Wood seized the opportunity and faked her own death to get back at her alleged cheating husband Robert Wagner. Before Woods new movie began with Walken, she hired a private investigator to follow her husband as she suspected him of sleeping around with younger starlets.

This week and next week, we're running a query letter clinic. We'll be looking at two types of query letters: the kind you send to agents and editors to get them to want to read your manuscript, and the kind you send to reviewers to get them to read your novel. We'll pick 5 random query letters this coming weekend and post them on our site one letter per day next week for analysis based on our experiences with querying. Commenters can leave helpful thoughts on why they might or might not request these manuscripts.

Keely generously invited all of us to her home one evening, for a beautiful dinner party with delicious Mexican food and other homemade treats; and we had the joy of meeting her family and being surrounded by her wonderfully artistic decor. Keely had transformed her living room into an art room, and the results were spirited and beautiful. As soon as we entered her home, we were literally surrounded by her whimsical and colorful works of art, perfectly arranged - almost like being in a Keely Gallery.
I used to think people did these sort of things out of a misdirected desire for connection, maybe that it’s true for some people and to some extent, but that certainly isn’t the only motive. These men don’t only pick up lonely women. They are often as successful with women who have boyfriends as with women who are unattached. I doubt all of those women really thought it would be or even wanted it to be more than a one night stand, if they’re really honest with themselves. I think sometimes we allow ourselves to be picked up because it affirms our sexuality and our sex appeal. We also need to feel like that person is worth being wanted by, thus the need for PUAs to come off as a “alpha males.” There wouldn’t be anything affirming about being seduced by a weak or pathetic man.
So what does this mean in your table design? For a square table, 30 inches will give you a small, four person table…let’s say a card table or a breakfast nook table. A rectangular table at 30 x 60 will allow six people easily… a nice little dining table. A 30 x 90 table (I just usually take it on up to 8 feet) can allow for 10 people.
It was nice having a little break from baking last week, no birthdays (none that I had to make cake for), and no other events, no last-minute thing, nothing. I did enjoy my sleep and not having to wake early to finish some cake or decorating. It wasn't too busy either at work so I could go home on time and play with my baby nephew. I did however, can't stay away for too long from baking. I made this cake last weekend just because for once, I didn't have any particular plan other than errands to do, and this cake has been on my to-try list for a while. So what's special about this cake, other than the fact that it doesn't scream Spring?
So here it is, one day after the last day of CNY, which is rather apt as well since this is my concluding and round-up post for all the festive baking I’ve been doing. I know many people do their cookie baking in December, because Europeans and Westerners in general tend to associate cookies with Christmas. For myself however, the cookie mania starts the month before Chinese New Year, whenever that is. This year, I’ve actually baked about 20 varieties of cookies, playing around with different recipes. Eventually I think I went back to my kampong bringing 16 types of cookies, most of which had good reviews from my relatives. I still have loads more cookies I want to attempt, but I’m shelving them for next year, and who knows, I might come up with even more ideas the next time.
I love this - the design, the prettiness, the sections. I especially love the Bible verse at the bottom, a little reminder of why I am doing what I do. When you work for a church the distinction between the profession and personal faith can become very blurry, so it is nice to know that amongst the practicalities there is a bigger picture to inspire me.

The word “Diamonds” and “forever” became forever linked in our culture. And what is even more remarkable…the way they positioned themselves as a benchmark of love, they reversed the dire trends. Diamonds were more valuable than ever.

Yesterday I also passed my book onto someone close to me with some of their own health concerns. D was off on a plane trip and I knew this was the perfect read. D was keen on reading more and was really interested in the story. I hoped it would give D the inspiration she needed. I also knew that if I had an ally in the fight against sugar addiction then I would have a fighting chance. Chocolate had always been the one thing I couldn’t give up and D was the same. I knew that if we did it together we had half a chance to succeed. D has diabetes type 2 and has tried plenty of other ways to loose weight with fairly minimal success. The next step is medication and that is not something D is interested in. This might be her last chance. D came home today and was pretty captivated in the book herself. D felt that this might be the book that changes her life! Yay for me! I’m not alone.

Here’s the part I wanted to share: when they got up to leave the whole restaurant began to clap and it got louder and louder. The waitresses and hostess were lined up to wish them well. The two Sushi chefs came out from their work stations and were standing along side of the other workers. They all bowed as the couple walked by. People in the restaurant offered comments out loud, “you look gorgeous”, “have fun”, “enjoy”, “drive safe”, “be careful driving”, “dance until your feet hurt”…….the owner of the restaurant thanked them very much for celebrating at their restaurant. Both the boy and the girl were blushing and smiling. Big, huge, happy smiles. They held hands as they walked through the restaurant and out the door. Things quieted down, really quiet after they left. Through the windows you could see them walking towards his dad’s car. Every one in the restaurant was hoping, HOPING, using esp and HOPING that he opened the door for her……………………

3) Speaking of youth, was Laura Dern seriously THIRTEEN when she made this movie?
Case in point: Dead City Radio, a 1990 release of recordings Burroughs made in the late 80's. Backed by a range of composers and performers including John Cale, Sonic Youth, Lenny Pickett, Donald Fagan and others, the soundscapes here range from jaunty 50's-nuclear-family cheeriness to groaning guitar feedback, all topped off by Burroughs' creaking, raspy monotone. We are treated to all manner of morbid weirdness: Excerpts about the Mugwumps from Naked Lunch, WSB reading from The Bible, pieces from his short story collection Tornado Alley, even a strangely touching piano-and-voice version of him slurring out the old standby "Falling In Love Again".... In German.
This doesn’t mean, of course, that The Strong One couldn’t come from Labour’s ranks. Harriet Harman is the most obvious candidate, if only because she has form when it comes to (a) openly saying she’d change any law at any time to get a post-dated conviction (b) targeting hate-sectors like bankers and white, older males, and (c) being so clearly bigoted and at least part way round the twist in her gender views. But Hattie herself knows she is unelectable – hence her support for Ed Miliband, as the great hope for becoming a sort of surrogate mother, hatching mad schemes and ‘equality’ quotients on Harmperson’s behalf.
I did not tell her that when we returned home we would set out a rat trap for the cute chipmunk. Actually, when we got home we examined the engine of our truck carefully using a flashlight. There was no sign of the chipmunk. I presume it had dismounted in town. I hope it followed the woman home. Obviously, they deserve each other.
Everybody has aspirations, desires and dreams. Some dream to be rich, some to become a celebrity and some to find true love. But we seldom think about what we are doing with our time, skills and energy towards attaining these things. More importantly we never think if we are truly working towards becoming worthy of what we desire for. The simple wisdom behind this states that if and when one becomes worthy of something they will soon acquire it. This means for example: if you wish to become a successful writer, then you will have to begin to hone your skills as a writer and keep learning to become better as a writer. And once you work towards such dreams you will eventually pave your way to becoming a great writer and success will eventually meet you. Likewise, if you do not conduct yourself in a manner that commands respect you will never get it by demanding it. You can never get true respect, love or recognition unless you earn them by your behaviour that is worth of such things.

I was nominated by the presumably lovely and unquestionably talented Emma of In Other Words . Thanks Emma – I’m not worthy of your praise. While I appreciate the award, it’s made writing even more challenging than it already was. It’s always been a bit daunting to hit the “Publish” button on a piece. With my award, I now have to ask myself,

When James knocks an elderly lady off her bicycle one night coming home from work, it sets forth the chain of events that shape this novel. One moment will incite in Kate the frustration and unhappiness and urge her to leave. James and Hugh, lifelong friends, had once congratulated themselves on how lucky they were to have found love and happiness with young, beautiful, smart and happy women. Now both of their comfortable, happy lives are in upheaval.

Preserve and protect the special thing that makes you who you are, no matter what. And be happy.

New experiences can be refreshing or can cause uneasiness
Every few years an Israeli Jewish politician floats a test balloon. He puts forward the idea that the areas where the Arab citizens of Israel live should be transfered --complete with the citizens-- to the future Palestinian state in exchange for Jewish settlement blocks in the West Bank. Those areas are highly fertile lands in comparison with the alternative option for a territorial swap (an empty zone in the Negev); but to paraphrase Golda Meir, they hate the Arabs more than they love the land.

Just as well I was there then because I could remind him face to face to respond to my challenge. I also told him that Metro FM have invited us both on air on Tuesday evening at 20h10 to discuss the scrap. I have accepted and I do hope Mangcu will. But I have my doubts. While he is quite happy to scribble insults in his column and print outright lies he certainly isn't keen to defend these views or actions face to face in front of either a radio or live audience. This is odd behaviour for a so called intellectual in pursuit of the truth. To me his refusal tells me all I need to know. You must draw your own conclusions.

Paper recycling is old news, but it seems to be an on-and-off venture for most people. Making recycled paper crafts into a business provides fuel to the recycling machine. If you look at bookstore displays, you’ll find coarse looking stationery and specialty papers. Even if these look old and rough, they are more expensive than those smoother and printed papers. Those coarse specialty papers are handmade and use natural fibers and recycled paper. You don’t need to buy a truckload of waste paper to get started. In fact, look around your house. Sort through your old files and see if there’s anything in there that you don’t need anymore. White office paper like bond papers are great for this recycling project.

Anyone watching ABC's The River? I like it enough to see where it goes for a few weeks. If you missed the first few episodes you can catch up here. If you want the quick version: They're on a boat in the Amazon searching for their lost father/husband/friend who went on some sort of magical quest. So far...monster, bugwalker, creepy doll tree, everyone goes blind(temporarily) and now you're all caught up for Tuesday's episode. I also really enjoy Once Upon A Time and Lost Girl. Grimm on the other hand has completely fallen off my radar.

However, my latest reading has made me very happy. You can’t complain about the book where the title of the first chapter is “Why it is hard to meet an average French person”. After reading several books on interviewing techniques (not that they were not interesting because three out of the four were!), a book that appears to teach one how to be French as a means of explaining the culture is amazing! And by amazing, I mean amusing… And I also have no idea why I’m reading this book.

The Beastie Boys are one of the most important and influential hip-hop groups of all time. They were instrumental in making hip-hop a global, mainstream force. Formed in 1981 as a hardcore band, they combined punk and rap into a singular sound that grew increasingly broad over the years, encompassing a vast array of genres. Yauch, Michael Diamond (Mike D), and Adam Horowitz (Ad-Rock) released several classic albums, including their debut album Licensed to Ill in 1986, 1989's Paul's Boutique, and 1994's Ill Communication.

For Example: If I drew SB.com Favorites from Jar 1 and #55 from Jar two I would look at the project in my Scrapbook.com Favorites and then use my 55th project in there that I had already marked as "Favorite" months ago. Scrap lift it or take some embellishment ideas from it... whatever
It’s been a very mixed bag for me photography wise. On one hand for astrophotography I want totally clear skies but for landscape I’d prefer a cloudy sky or at least some clouds in the sky. Clouds give you options, slow the exposure down and you can streak the clouds, or if you’re lucky enough to get huge high contrast clouds it can give a shot real drama. Clouds also help a sunset along no end; a slightly cloudy sky will always yield a better sunset than a clear sky will.

Like Queen Victoria, Ferdinand did not grow up expecting to rule. He was born in 1863 and trundled along being the eldest son of his archduke father, but nothing else loomed on the horizon until 1899, when Crown Prince Rudolph died in a suicide pact at his hunting lodge at Mayerling. (The photo is of Rudolph, but he and Ferdinand looked a lot alike.)
He slowly ran his knife down her leg, searching. There they were, twined in the
Visions delivers a diverse, yet distinctive avant-garde album comprised with unmistakable hook-heavy songs that transcend genres. Grimes greets her audience with an astonishing repertoire that it’s hard to believe the range she possesses. Some songs are perfect for the dance floor while others feel out of this world with a nod to 80s pop music. If you enjoy artists like Lykke Li, Crystal Castles, and the Cocteau Twins, Grimes is a must listen!
I made a silly mistake last time I was in America and forgot to pack my hiking shoes. I didn’t discover this until I was looking for them to pack for this trip, so the best shoes I had for the job were my runners. They’re okay, but don’t provide any ankle support and lack the gripping power of real hiking shoes. Oh, well.
Dinner in Broadway Joe's was followed by drinks, more drinks and then possibly a drink or two. Five of us showed the city a good time and finished up in an Irish bar. Where else would you go for a fun night out?
The delays didn’t take away from the action in the ring as 8 Count put together a fairly competitive card for the night. A raucous cheering section supported local fighters Dimar Ortuz, Adan Ortiz and Granados all night long while Marlon Smith learned that the easiest way to get heat from the crowd

But there are still bands out there that can put together a hell of a good album, and this series, like my old bliss-out posts, is a little celebration of albums, particularly the ones that are well-built... and perhaps it's an elegy for them too, now that the album as artform is becoming less and less relevant in the face of music videos and EPs that can boast a higher hit-song to track-listing ratio (available for 99 cents on iTunes!)

They have compost, squash (SIGH - we winterized everything before the big freeze but forgot to bring the squash stored in the greenhouse inside.....so we have a pile of mushy once frozen squash to feed the chickens....) and I pick a bucket of grass/chickweed for them every day. They love their greens....Today we got 14 eggs from 14 chickens!
We had to wake up at 2:30 am! We drove to the airport with some funny old ladies who laughed and snorted. Our plan got to Miami, Florida at 9:45 am. At 10:45 am we left for Santo Domingo. We touched down at Santo Domingo at 1:45 pm. Then we went to our hotel and ate lunch. Factoid: every day in Santo Domingo it rains around 3 pm. Then we took some nice long naps. Next, we watched TV. Finally we went out to dinner with a group of people.

When I left local government many new appointments, particularly of senior staff, were being made on short term contracts. For most staff there was no security of employment with cost cutting exercises taking place every year. Services kept suffering as fewer people were there to do the jobs expected by the public. Those that remained spent more and more time gathering statistics for government targets which were becoming harder and harder to achieve in the vicious circle. The rest of the time they were ensuring that there was sufficient paperwork to protect themselves from the culture of blame and litigation sweeping in from the other side of the Atlantic. In short local government had ceased to be a place where all one had to remember was that one had to serve the public and get on with the job of doing that. For many it had become a fight for survival. It had become a place where one's first loyalty was to making sure that one could putting food into the mouths of one's family.
Lemley said that he's seen estimates on the number of suits filed by non-practicing entities that range wildly, from 2% to 50% of all patent litigation. In addition, many struggle even to define what makes a so-called "patent troll" that acquires patents to use in court, and what makes a legitimate non-practicing entity.

One of the common motives for farm murders is robbery, and robbery with violence, or the threat of violence, is all too common. For that purpose, farms are seen as a soft target because of their relative isolation. There is time for the robbers to make a getaway.

According to a study involving doctors at Rhode Island Hospital, between May 2009 and November 2010, six patients were admitted to the emergency room there because of wire bristle ingestion. These patients came in complaining of abdominal pain and painful swallowing. They all had just eaten grilled meat. CT scan and x-ray results showed that there were wires in the abdomens and throats of the patients. The doctors determined that these were the grill brush bristles that had come off and gotten stuck in the meat. The study’s lead author, radiologist David Grand, says they don’t know if this is a widespread problem. He is, however, calling for more research.

Pours dark amber color with heavy lacing. Has a sweet taste with a slightly thick mouth feel. A second glass revealed this to be more malty than hoppy and highly carbonated. There’s a taste of roasted nuts or bread there too with a sweet finish. Hard to find hereabouts and pricey from what I hear, but worth a try for sure.
Scattered. It is the only way to describe my brain of late. I have quite the obessional mind and I would like to start using this for good instead of teenage crushes and buying into someone elses created world. If I am not obsessing over our impending holiday of AWESOME, then it is about the dog that I want. Sometimes I even spend hours looking for exactly the right name for my yet unborn puppy.

This journey of grief in so many ways is a privilege. I feel honored to walk this road and to learn more about my Savior and about my family. I feel blessed to have loved Samuel so much that his absence is deeply painful. And I feel so inexpressibly grateful for Samuel's life. It is among the greatest gifts of my life. And I think this road will be perpetually refining, and for that I am also truly thankful.

I finally staged an intervention for her with all of her kids at my house. All the grown daughters were angry and depressed and everyone cried. They felt crushed and betrayed, and although sympathetic to their mother’s plight, they wanted the fighting between their parents to stop. They said it was unbearable for them. After listening to her children, Annie finally grasped that her antics were hurting her relationship with them.
“What I Do?” This is one of my favorite lines I use, and always spoken with a hard southern Bill Clinton accent, when I ask folks why they are pissed about something I said. I am the type of guy who will ask a question, in response to comments people make. I will respond to comments I here in the grocery line,at work, in a tavern, or at a family Christmas party. Nobody gets a free pass on publicly made comments.
“Our feasibility study is ongoing and in October, we filed the necessary documents with the NRC to reactivate our license, which is currently in timely renewal status.

Recently the media has been full of talk about peace and ceasefires. However one group has not given the slightest indication that they are willing to end the vicious campaign which they have been waging for years and which their very existence depends upon. The group in question is of course the Irish rich.

Numeira is an interesting case. For, by the time the catastrophe occurred, the city had been abandoned. Whether this was in response to the first earthquake, or whether Numeira, which may have been an astrological observatory and so might have seen the raining sulfur before it approached the city, is unknown. It’s quite possible that the city was abandoned before any of these events, as it had become economically unfeasible as a community, due to the natural arridness of the region. Whatever the case, they left. Not one person within the environs of “Gommorrah” died as a result of the “fire from heaven”.

The council could use the current surplus as a temporary measure in order to avoid the cuts for now. This would make the council extremely popular amongst the workers and the community in general. (A far cry from the harsh reality of the feelings towards the council at the moment) The council could then use this popularity to build a mass campaign throughout the county to defend the council against any attack from the Assembly or Westminster and to demand the money necessary for all the jobs and services needed within the area.
Not many people know this, but there are more of us dogs in San Francisco than there are kids. So guess what: we're just as much a part of this city as anyone else is.

In essence, the conservative person is simply one who finds the permanent things more pleasing than Chaos and Old Night. (Yet conservatives know, with Burke, that healthy "change is the means of our preservation.") A people's historic continuity of experience, says the conservative, offers a guide to policy far better than the abstract designs of coffee-house philosophers. But of course there is more to the conservative persuasion than this general attitude."

Director Tim Story mixes it up, keeping all the multiple storylines in play without so much as a hiccup in pacing or narrative. This could have ended up a two-hour commercial for Harvey’s book, but Story shifts the focus to the individual characters and not the pages of Harvey’s narrative. Screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman let you see the action from all sides, so this feels like a true ensemble film instead of a man or woman-bashing screed. And as an ensemble piece, it’s tough to pick out the truly outstanding performances, because the actors do such a wonderful job working with each other. That said, Kevin Hart (Kevin Hart: Seriously Funny) is brilliant as always, and manages to steal just about every scene he’s in. His post-divorce bitter manchild is an absolute hoot. And D.C. native Taraji P. Henson brings a softness to her COO that weighs a man’s net worth higher than a man’s heart. Well, at first anyway.
It shouldn't shock me, but it does, that almost two decades after Rodney King some officers still fail to grasp that with the proliferation of consumer video recorders, they are less and less likely to get away with excessive use of force.

Still in sewing mode: I couldn’t go to our final rowing presentation dinner without appropriately coloured attire. I didn’t have a dress or skirt that would have been comfy and warm so I grabbed trousers, a slinky little sleeveless t-shirt top and a jacket. They were all right as far as colour was concerned, but they were all the same colour and we do have the choice of black and white and grey, or just black and white if we can’t do much else. I decided that a scarf would be a good way to add a bit of colour. I didn’t have one, so I made one. In my stash I had a large piece of fabric I’d probably intended to use for a top. Some might argue that its background colour is not really white but rather cream. The flowers and stripes are black. In the dim light of the function centre, it was black-and-white enough to be obvious that I was aiming in the right direction.

I did that this morning and everyone of them turned their backs on me – literally. One of them I’ll need to watch more closely for diet. She’s showing signs of diarrhea. I’m feeding Co-Op Creep; or maybe she just got more than her share.

I don't actually believe that, at bottom, writing historical fiction is any different from writing any other kind of fiction: characterisation, structure, prose, plot, process... We're writing for readers now, and so all those things must work for witers and readers Now. But the usual challenges come in different proportions, because of the fundamental definition of historical fiction - at least that of Margaret Atwood, which is the only definition which is useful for a writer.: "fiction set in a time before the writer came to consciousness."

This is great for you because it means you can buy your own gift—and you know exactly what you’d like. In the olden days, you had to drop mega-hints and hope for the best. Some women, having given up completely, would get the gift themselves, give it to their husband to wrap, then feign surprise upon opening it.
These pictures were taken over a month ago, when the daffodils in the forest behind out house were blooming. That we’ve got huge clumps of daffodils randomly placed in the forest, and (until I planted some last summer) none in the yard is a mystery. Did the previous owners of our house plant them there? Did they just naturally grow there? Will I kill them if I replant them in the yard so that I can watch them bloom? So many questions.

More than anything, it seems like Watts wants young journalists to utilize social media to their advantage, to realize it is now part of their jobs. A week after our interview, she was insisting I create a Twitter account. I’m grateful to her – part of this project is my personal metamorphosis as a journalist. I hope you benefitted from her words as much as I have! Until next time!

Following my MRI and visit with the orthopedic surgeon, the final diagnosis is better than I had feared. It is not a ligament rupture; it is a plain stress fracture of the Navicular and possibly also the cuboid, two of the chunky bones on the top of your foot at the ankle. It appears the main culprit was running down hills, something I will have to be very careful with in the future. I was surprised that I had cracked the chunky bone rather than the long thin metatarsals, but there are big ligaments that attach to the chunky ones and pull hard enough to fracture them when pulled over and over and over and over.

See, though I do not talk about it here I have Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia.) Add to the mix that I am naturally a very shy and introverted girl you have a total social misfit, lol. So, I really do not know if I will ever make friends around this area. Other people seem to communicate so easily and I always just feel like an awkward spectator, not ever really connecting with anyone.

To make sure that the audience really gets it, you should incorporate the Rule of Three while revealing your character’s money-hungry nature. For example, if she’s a pick pocket, maybe she gets away with it twice, and gets caught the third time. She’s unapologetic when caught, the song changes, and then she continues to reveal her obsession with money throughout the act.
I have felt so unsettled this year. I started off the year with the seed of a possibility of moving, which grew and grew, and we readied our home for sale by painting and boxing up belongings. Then we moved and have been in temporary housing since July. I feel dislodged, without a nest to feather. My home is not my refuge. I would like to get into my new house (looks like we'll close mid February!) and make it my home. I also only did one show in 2010, and the lack of that creative outlet has been really difficult. I hope to have more theatre in my life in 2011. I also want more confidence. I feel shaken after this move... unsure and unsettled and without not only a home, but a PLACE... and my confidence has plummeted.

Afterwards we headed to the bookstore, where I kept getting distracted, then home to take a shower and wind down.
I bought an 8x8 album (already covered in faux fur) -- I covered the inside covers with scrapbook paper, added glittered chipboard letters to the front with the Ultimate Glue, and some photo corners & acetate for her picture, and added some picture pockets inside in addition to the 8x8 pages. Then, I found these great 4x6 cards at Michaels along with some coasters & a luggage tag -- all in the dollar bins (plus I used a coupon!). I used the luggage tag to make her a bookmark. The 4x6 cards were for friends & family to write their memories of Emily on--then they were added to the picture pockets, and pictures were added to the photo pages as well. My sister set these cards out at her party and asked those that attended to write a memory/congratulatory wishes on the cards, and added them to her book. Some family members had already added a few pages, such as our family. Some of the 8x8 pages were also used as collages and such. I also changed the plain white pages to decorative scrapbook papers in matching color themes --some of the 8x8 pages can also become pockets for cards/memorabilia she'd like to keep as well.
After Macy’s I talked to Patrick about the vests and the suits. The sale was just for the jacket and pants and it wasn’t very good. It would have been $220 then the vest was $75 and we would still need the shirt and tie, which would probably be another $50. We just could not ask the guys to spend $350 on a suit for a wedding … and that is before tax!
And the women always look amazing, straight from the beauty parlor. I assume straight from the salon, since that is what I would do if I only got my hair done once a week. That must have been a busy time for the salons in Fort Collins. I would schedule my appointment the day before and sleep in a chair that night.

The number of people in the 50-60% range, the reasonably well-off low-income people, has remained stable in the range of 4 to 4.8 million between 1979 and 2009. The 40-50%, not particularly well-off low-income people, have had more of a rocky ride and are up from 2 million in 1979 to 3.5 million in 2009. But the poor sods on 40% or less have rocketed from 1.3 million to 5.9 million (up from 2.4% of the population to 9.8%).
Former Home Secretary Jack Straw last year accused some Pakistani men of seeing white girls as ‘easy meat’ for sexual abuse following the jailing of another grooming gang in Derby. The latest case was conducted against a backdrop of racial politics.

Last week I was told I was too old to wear t-shirts with anything printed on them. Plain tee's are all that are left for me. When I questioned the rule, I was told because I didn't immediately tell them to mind their own business I didn't "own my choices" and that proved I shouldn't be wearing them. Until that moment in time it had never occurred to me that people might think I was trying too hard to look young by wearing a t-shirt with a SF saying on it or a wine comment. They just made me laugh and I just thought my other SF friends would get a kick out of it. Will I wear the T-Shirts again? Yes. Will I ever feel as happy wearing them as I did before? No. No matter how much I say other people's opinions don't matter, there will always be a small part of me that wonders who is judging my outfit and deciding I don't measure up.

Oh I know I should have been better prepared. I should have planned in advance. I should have, but I didn’t. Then I took Nurse Meme day off and flounced around all day and got nothing done. Well nothing except went to Wal*Mart. That brings me to another side track. I believe we need more rules in this country. One of which is if you are going to make me pick dog poop up off of your dirt then you should be made to pick your child’s poop up off the Wal*Mart bathroom floor. I think that is a good rule.
Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who led the research being reported Wednesday, said last month that the changes to his paper “were mainly a more in-depth explanation of the significance of the findings to public health and a description of the laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.”
Sweat ran in rivulets as Wei Tsu Tin struggled forward fighting the waist-deep water and dense undergrowth of the Okefenokee swamp. Not an inch of Wei’s skin was dry. The areas of deep folds and tight crevices were starting to chafe. As he peeled yet another leech off of his arm, the general cursed the ancestors of the Americans that he and his troops were chasing deeper and deeper into the swamp. Then he cursed all Americans as well as their “free” country. Where were the riches that he had been promised? Where were the assets to be recovered for Wei’s own homeland. How would these backwater savages ever repay their debt?
I am also giddy because I've launched myself out there more in the blogosphere, doing some commenting here and there and feeling the LOVE of all the people visiting my blog and then following me! Which is so sweet of everyone and I hope I can live up to their expectations. It's an increase of about 30%. (Did you see how I did that calculation? I know, so geeky.) We can blame my new blog friend Jen. She inspired me to get my a** in gear. Well, that and actually participating in the blog give and take.

Of all the broad religious traditions, I think Buddhism comes closest to retaining the spirit of its founder and greatest teacher, Gautama the Buddha. Buddhists have never started a war to advance their cause. No one has ever been forced to convert to Buddhism.

In my opinion, some of the most memorable and defining moments in D&D come as a result of those split-second decisions that players must make about how far to risk their characters' life and limbs. You know what I'm talking about. Your party is being decimated by a pack of ghouls. Grumple the dwarf has been cut off from the rest of the party, trapped in a room with four ghouls closing in for the kill. He's wounded and will surely die if left to his own devices. Meanwhile, the other three grieviously wounded party members have an escape route - 50' of open hall in front of them - beckoning...

My worry is that once the Likudniks begin to realize Obama may not be defeated by the GOP at home, the current Israeli government would launch a war without warning to create a crisis to humiliate the president, rally end-times evangelicals to vote, send oil prices soaring, and force the US president to coopt a war he does not want and does not yet believe is necessary. If that helps the GOP nominee, so much the better. Every GOP candidate is now committed to the most extreme positions of the Likudnik Israeli right - and are to the bellicose right of most Israelis.

Somehow, with all the excitement of the unified patent court and the unitary patent system for Europe buzzing round his ears, this member of The SPC Blog team quite forgot that Case C‑518/10, Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd, Aventis Holdings Inc v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, a reference for a preliminary ruling from the Court of Appeal (England and Wales), was still in the pipeline. This case has sped through the judicial corridors of Luxembourg, arriving in November 2010 and departing -- in the form of an Order -- on 25 November which was handed down this morning.
Jenny Tonge has never said anything hostile to the Jewish community in Britain. Only a liar like Bright (or an anti-Semite – since Bright is not Jewish it is highly likely that his support for Zionism is, as was the case with most non-Jewish Zionists, motivated by anti-Semitism) could confuse British Jews for Zionism and Israeli Jews .

Reviewing these books, we can now see that Banks set aside the notion of operating under the Charters they hold as banks, instead of being Banks they became like very poor casino operators and traders, selling what they do not own.

Claudia is understanding more, I know she doesn't understand on the grand scheme level, but she knows enough to talk about Curtis and that does help. Today we were at a tea party My Other Blog and were at a table with a few grandmas and their granddaughters. One asked another little girl how many brothers she had. The grandmother said something about her having a brother who died and they are trying to "encourage" her to be aware of him and making sure to mention him.
First, in John’s Gospel, Jesus uses the title “woman” to politely address other women with whom he has a positive relationship. This is seen, for example, when Jesus tenderly appears to Mary Magdalene on Easter Sunday (Jn. 20:15), when He forgives the sins of the woman who committed adultery (Jn. 8:10), and when He draws the Samaritan woman to faith in the Messiah (Jn. 4:21). Given the positive way this address appears in John’s Gospel, Jesus calling Mary “woman” would not indicate a rebuke or lack of affection.

The S&P 500 index is now down to important support levels supported first by the simple 200 day moving average and second by the March 2011 lows (blue line). The long term moving average is not by itself not really significant nor magical. But it is psychologically important since it is foremost in traders’ minds. Losing the support of the long term trend makes many fearful of further losses and usually results in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Let’s set the stage. The subject: white male or female; protestant; 50+ years old; politically conservative; middle class; regular church attendant. The circumstance: Aaron happens into a conversation with this individual that starts innocently enough but quickly becomes more serious. The topic: the condition of our country. The subject’s conclusion: our country is in terrible condition and needs to go back to how it used to be. The result: Aaron tries to make vaguely general nods of the head or other types of polite acknowledgements without agreeing with his conversational partner and attempts to change the subject.

I recently attended Secret Church: The Cross and Suffering at The Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham, Alabama. I cannot even begin to unpack all that I learned and that I am continuing to learn from my time there. Suffice it to say, David Platt could be a professional auctioneer and we covered 220-something pages and 75 key texts in 1 night. Now, we all know that I am a Nerd (yes, that’s “nerd” with a capital “N”), but whoa Nelly! my mind was so moving so fast that night that I think a little bit of it is still spinning trying to comprehend everything that I learned. Perhaps that is why I took no less than 4 trips to the main office building today at work in 20 minutes because I kept forgetting something. Yes, that sounds like a good excuse.

In between the women, Byron did manage some verses – Beppo, the first part of Don Juan and a part of the tragedy Marin Faliero.

Wickets of the Gothams, already informed me a former member of the Gothams moved to Ohio and founded the Capitals Base Ball Club back in 1998. Bandit's better half confirmed that and expanded the story for me. It was a gentleman named Charlie who moved to Ohio and founded the team. He went by the nickname of LEFTY, but has since retired from the game. He now devotes his time to the company he started out of his garage. For Lefty also happens to be the founder of the Phoenix Bats Company, hailing out of Plain City, Ohio.

So what is the project? Solar-powered and lit from within, with a DVD player and monitors, it tries to rethink the hospital waiting room; in fact, the cartoon-like, festive structure with a kind of external tattoo of abstract graphics, is "sited at Policlinico Umberto 1, Rome's largest public hospital, and one that has been recently controversial because of scandals of unsafe and unsanitary conditions."As an "enlightenment" era hospital, it was planned in a decentralized way, with specialities (pediatrics, respiratory maladies, contagious diseases) distributed throughout the campus, with no single central space. The project attempts to create a centralized space for all kinds of waiting (waiting for an appointment, to be picked up, the diagnosis of a loved one, for treatment, convalescing to recover).As Inaba himself explained in a recent issue of Art Review, the real purpose was “to create an environment to cope with our restlessness, if not through easing the irritation of having to wait, then at least through distraction from it."

Communication remains the key to everything we do, and so we have been careful to cover all the bases to keep you informed. We have asked the Galactic Federation to make itself fully known to you after disclosure is announced, and have asked the Agarthans to do likewise. Each of you needs to acquire full knowledge of what is happening and why, and where it is all headed. It is equally important for us to have feedback from you regarding this sudden flurry of events to hit your societies. We, the Ascended Masters, intend to appear and heal and bless all of you even before the mass landings. We sincerely ask for your feelings on these matters as the time has come to change how you interact with Heaven. You are each a sacred physical angel. You need to learn about your divine lineage and the sacred Orders you are a part of. Ponder on these matters, as Heaven is now returning in force to your world!

What’s even more troubling is that in Nigeria, the country that has arguably suffered most from oil drilling, oil “accidents”—large and small—occur almost weekly, and we hear little about it. A lethal combination of sloppiness, corruption, weak regulation, and lack of accountability has meant that each year since the 1960s, there has been a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez’s into the Niger Delta. Large purple slicks cover once fertile fields, and rivers are clogged with oil leaked decades ago. It has been called the “black tide”: a stain of thick, gooey oil that has oozed over vast tracts of land and poisoned the air for millions of Africans. In some areas fish and birds have disappeared: the swamps are silent.

James and Mary took off toward James’ house to help Marlene in the delivery of their fourteenth child. Mary loved being a grandmother. She took pride in telling everyone what a wonderful mess of grand kids she had. Howie started back down that ladder. This is when the heavy bags shifted and came crashing down on top of Howie knocking him off the ladder, pinning him to the floor. With no one knowing he was in trouble, Howie laid there, praying for someone to find him. He died that evening from internal bleeding. The injuries which took his life couldn’t have been repaired, even if he had been found. This was a time when advanced medicine wasn’t much more than a stethoscope and a tongue depresser. It wasn’t until the following day, when he didn’t show up for supper, that his body was found, by his father. Everyone attended the funeral and Summer was literally beside herself. She married and widowed twice, before she turned fifteen was as devastating as it could be to such a young woman. Both of her husbands died in terrible accidents and this caused folks to start calling Summer “the black widow.” This only added salt to her wounds of loss.

I don't want to ride her in the saddle I have until I am absolutely happy that it fits and is not going to make her sore. In the meantime, while we are still walking, I might ride her bareback - I have been long-reining her up and down a long paddock at the yard, so I may ride her bareback to begin with in there. I don't much fancy hacking out bareback, as she will undoubtedly spook...and I would either fall off or have to grip really hard - which doesn't exactly help!
Rock: Just before reaching the Church Street end, you will encounter two ravines that converge near the trail on the left. The boulders are so plentiful that they resemble the ramparts of a fortress. You may find it hard to resist scrambling up them. If you decide to make the short climb, check out the view from the rocky outcrop nearest the trail and next to a small stream for a fine view of the forest floor and the lake beyond.

This haunting “fictional biography” focuses on a figure who has fascinated countless fans for decades: Marilyn Monroe. In Blonde, Joyce Carol Oates uses the objectification Monroe experienced to explore what her inner life might have been like—the thoughts and feelings that even those closest to her were not privy to. Going far beyond the simplistic summaries of Monroe as a sex symbol or a “girl who wanted to be loved”, Oates wrestles with the complexities and contradictions of her life, providing a fresh, intriguing perspective on the famous actress and model.
When Grace awakens, she's no longer in her own body. As she roams the hospital hallway, she finds that her daughter, Jenny, is having the same experience. Grace learns that she has suffered irreversible brain damage, and Jenny has severe burns all over her body and face. The prognosis for both of them is bleak and to further complicate matters, arson is the suspected cause of the fire.
While their focus sometimes slips a little, Vedaki creates something exotic, surprising and so seamlessly organic it sounds derived from an ancient tradition all its own; from some land where their Russian, Indian and West African ancestors forged a common musical language centuries ago.

Her idea of bloggers and real people having an innate populist talent for creating well designed and beautifully decorated spaces jibed with my own feelings. She also included personal back stories about each home she chose to photograph and write about, and this makes the book have depth. And that she traveled to each location, and each home, and got to know each space, each town or city, and each home owner, this certainly adds another layer of personality and richness."

Anna was sympathetic and as helpful as she could be, but since the jurisdiction over my child support and custody issues lies out-of-state, there were limits to what she could do and say. Nonetheless, after the mystifying confrontation I had in court with a Legal Aid lawyer bearing a clipboard with Anna’s name on it, I had to renew contact to find out what the hell was going on. That council landlords are supposed to go to was worthless for advice of any kind, and Judge Crime obviously didn’t owe me an explanation.
In this piece (not a great pic I realize) I have hidden symbols and images alluding to the struggle that is involved in finding one’s center (including the four directions). I suppose it’s a bit feminine in nature, but I almost called it finding the warrior’s center because I did feel a bit like a warrior trying to fight my way to freedom from all my worries.

I loved the counterbalance with thin, crispy crust, al dente gnocchi, and the chewy and still slightly crunchy rapini. All held together by the sweet/tart huckleberry.
I have been wanting to make a mix berry oatmeal version as well but the carrot cake variation won so this later one will come to the blog very soon as well, so stay tuned.
The interesting thing about the protest is that it is not instigated or organized by any political parties. It is an organic and spontaneous protest by the people from all walks of life, young and old, men and women and children,Muslims and Christians alike.

I started on this post a few weeks back and then realized I should hang onto the thought until the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, which is today! The daylight hours here in Paris have become incredibly long: today the sun rises at 5:47 am and won't set until 9:58 pm. Compare this with back home in DC where the sun rises at roughly the same time but sinks below the horizon a full hour and a half earlier.
Ralegh at once followed his unlucky forerunners.

You have to be good, though. That's why it's so important to do the best you can, even if you don't really like what you do. Your abilities might be able to pay off somehow.
And to a small child, seeing a violent act without the real-life consequences of pain and emotional hurt is totally normalizing that behaviour and making it seem like it's not big deal.
I saw the omnipotent’s flaming pioneers
After an amazing first night out with our international friends in the Berlin nightlife, we started the next day a bit delayed. We saw many well-known landmarks and impressive buildings in the following days but one highlight were doubtless a few of the famous historical sight-seeing places.
Despite the fact that probably my all-time favorite children’s book is The Very Hungry Caterpillar, I despise the way caterpillars’ bodies slink. Nevermind that they usually turn into delicate butterflies, which I love. I mean, nevermind that they’re the same darn creature in either form. It doesn’t matter. With their many pairs of legs fanning their long bodies out like a wave as they clamber across the sidewalk and up the trees, I can’t help but get the willies.

I didn't realize how much I would miss her
Yesterday at around 5 pm, F3 ventured yet again into one of the traps. She was caught several weeks ago, but released because the field crew thought she might be lactating and didn’t want to keep her from her kits at what would have been a crucial time. Her behavior since that incident raised suspicions that she wasn’t, in fact, denning, and when she went into the trap yesterday, we headed to Montana, arriving at two in the morning and getting up at six to go the trap. The risk to any hypothetical kits would have been reduced by the fact that they would now be old enough to be left for a greater length of time.
Now, once the seat part is all smoothed and tucked and pinned in the creases, smooth upward along the backrest. Work your way up the middle and tuck each edge into the sides pinning as you move up. Once you reach the top of the chair, take as much pins as needed and pin as tight as you can to assure that the fabric does not shift and is smooth. This is very important because if the pins are not snug, they will pop out eventually (not SAFE AT ALL).

When I burst through the bed room door last night, hands on my hips and lips pursed, Paul had a pretty good idea he was about to go face to face with pregnancy craziness. After all, he's accompanied me on the pregnancy journey enough times to recognize the signs.

For some time now, I've been waiting for someone to ask me why I didn't honor a particular, recently deceased person. I would then explain my reasons in the comment section. I thought it might be Tony Curtis, but nobody ever asked about him. Poor Tony. Instead, in the comment section of an "In Memoriam" honoring Don Meredith, fellow blogger and frequent visitor Dreamfarm Girl wanted to know why I was ignoring Elizabeth Edwards, who died around the same time.

In much the same way as sailors personify the sea Heaney treats nature as a living entity, not just a variety of living things something that might “clutch” him and drag him under. Perhaps this is where his fascination developed around 1970 for the Iron Age bodies that had been found in bogs throughout Ireland and Denmark.[10] As much as Heaney could be described a nature poet what strikes me here in this collection is Heaney’s fear of nature and the ways in which the commonplace can become threatening or evil. This is exactly what I got from ‘Mr. Bleaney’ in which the ordinary and everyday becomes menacing. I have to wonder just what Heaney’s experiences of nature were growing up. As the eldest child it must have been anticipated that Seamus might follow in his father's footsteps and yet he chose to reject that lifestyle. This is probably evidenced in the first poem of the collection, ‘Digging’ in which he sits in his room writing whilst his father digs outside:
As it is across generations, might it be across the individuals that make up the generational branches of a family tree?

A sister mentioned how she was in need of prayer. Great she wanted help, and she asked for it. The Holy Spirit immediately brought to mind a scripture. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. James 5:16a,b (KJV) We should pray for, help and lift up one another. Be determined to no longer have your hand in the pot only to take, but also to add something of value. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full–pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back. Luke 6:38 (NLT)
Have I mentioned how much I loved that car. There was an ache in my chest when I realized I was going to have to part with it.
So then I go on. the road is good and the edge is marked with a white strip. This was really good because the headlights form the oncoming vehicles can be blinding, so I would focus my headlamp on the white strip and ride when they came. The trucks would sometimes even give me a dipper, lower their lights for an instant and that really helped. The climb was tiring, but I’d been expecting it so it was ok. That way the altitudinal profile was very helpful. Soon it started becoming light and I found myself riding a smooth, broadly undulating road. I passed Ayanur in this early morning light before the sun was up and stopped in my tracks as I spotted a large owl sitting on a peepal right above the middle of the road. I could barely make out it’s silhouette and it flew away as I looked up and saw its eye-shine. There were nice forest patches between the villages now and I passed by some patches that looked like erstwhile teak plantations.

I had tried an Ergo early last summer, but ended up selling it to a friend. So many of my friends had raved about them, but I never seemed to be able to get it to fit comfortably. It was hard for me to buckle the top clasp when I was wearing my little one on the front, and I always ended up with intense pain along my spine and between my shoulder blades when I wore it. And by the time I tried the Ergo, I had so much practice tying a baby wrap that it was actually faster for me to put on a wrap than the Ergo!

I’m having severe pain from plantar fasciitis and a subsequent cortisone shot in my heel. Since I can hardly walk, I’m stuck in bed or on the couch feeling lame. To make the best of it, I set up my computer in the living room and pillows to prop my leg up, and then I used my awkward positioning to help me stretch throughout the day. Injuries can be a real setback when you’re trying to lose weight because your physical activity is limited. But movement of any kind is better than no movement at all, and stretching is the easiest way to maintain mobility. It also just feels good.

So why don’t I just leave my husband you might be asking? I stay because of my children. I stay because they are so normal and smart and well adjusted. I don’t want to do anything to hurt that.

I've been thinking about RENT, and how you feel, and how I feel, and how other people feel, and I've come to some conclusions. The first is that I don't really like it. As a person who likes musicals, theatre, rock music, and opera; and having heard (read: been forced to listen to) entire broadway recordings a considerable amount; on a strictly musical and musical-theatre level, I dont think it's great. It uses the opera format to get out of having to write decent dialogue; it uses the rock music format to get out of having to write real melodies; and it uses the musical-theatre format to avoid the density of material required by a dramatic play about the same subject matter.

Kaufman says some banks are so big that their failure could trigger a chain reaction in the financial system. The cost of borrowing for so-called too-big-to-fail banks is lower than that of smaller firms because lenders believe the government won’t let them go under. The perceived safety net creates what economists call moral hazard -- the belief that bankers will take greater risks because they’ll enjoy any profits while shifting losses to taxpayers.

First of all, one must be a “visualist.” That isn’t a real word, but it describes what I mean. A person who is stunned by physical natural beauty (certainly not at the exclusion of aural, tactile, or emotional stimuli) possesses visual aqueducts to the world through his or her eyes. Infinitesimal flashes of stunning images move him beyond belief. These impressions are captured in his mind’s eye, never to be lost, forever to be savored. And often, when this type of writer is creating, they see the “movie in their mind,” pressing from within, allowing readers to feel intimate and involved in a scene.

Open Book: I’ve never met Anna Quindlen, but I feel like I know her through her books and novels, and having looked at a series of pictures of her at different ages in the current issue of More magazine, I know we sort of look alike, except for our noses. And having read her over the years, I know we share remarkably similar interests and views. So much so that after reading a NetGalley digital copy of Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake (Random House), I bought two hardcover copies — one for my college roommate for her birthday, and one for me just because.

What, exactly does that imply? Salvation is no longer of the Jews. We are not under the Law of Moses but under grace. Jesus Christ died for the sins of all the world regardless of nationality or religion. It implies that Israel failed to be a kingdom of priests and rather than being a channel of blessing have joined the Gentiles in unbelief.

Like most everything else in my home . . . this one has great memories attached to it as well. You see, I was in England, Wales, and Scotland in the Spring of 2002 for a month-long vacation. It was one of those trips where I just began dog-earring pages in all my favourite travel books . . . and then figured out a route that would take me to each of them. London. Glouster. Chester. York. Edinburgh. Aberdeen. Inverness. And so on. But, the day I was supposed to leave York and head north to Scotland, there had been an over-night storm that had closed most of the train service - and one could only travel in case of emergencies. (well, my emergency was that a small antique store in Edinburgh had this tea service on hold for me - I had been speaking with them via phone for months) So, I kinda fibbed a little. And boarded a bus from York going north. Needless to say . . . this little tea service has served me well for many years. I bough several pieces that day - so don't fret - I still have plenty of reminders of that trip at the house.
How do you save a drowning person? Lifeguards experience this when someone is floundering in the water. Sometimes they wait, observing the victim and when all strength is gone, and they are unable to fight back, they jump in to the rescue. At such a stage the drowning person gives up and the rescuer takes over.
Oh my goodness I had childhood flashbacks when I saw these in separate shops. In fact I did talk myself out of the purple one whilst out shopping with BearsFootprints.

An improvement on the chain rakes is the so-called “porcupine” machinery, which has, perhaps, been more extensively adopted than any other form of mashing apparatus. Of an example of this form of mashing machine we gave an engraving on page 532 of our number for the 29th of May last, our illustration representing a vertical section and plan of one of the cast-iron mash-tuns at Messrs. Truman’s brewery, which mash-tuns we may mention, are all, with one exception, also fitted with Steel’s masher, which we shall describe presently. The mashing apparatus of which we are now speaking, consists, as will be seen, of a series of rakes carried by curved arms fixed to a pair of horizontal shafts placed one above the other; the rakes being arranged so that, as the shafts revolve, they pass each other and thoroughly turn over the “goods” in the mash-tun. The inner ends of the horizontal shafts are carried by plummer blocks attached to brackets which encircle the central vertical, or driving, shaft, the lower end of which latter shaft rests upon a suitable bearing at the bottom of the mash-tun. The outer ends of the rake shafts rest in bearings carried by a kind of frame, which is connected by tie bars with the brackets encircling the central shaft, and which is supported by a pair of rollers which bear on the rim of the mash-tun. The upper part of this frame also carries bearings for a pair of shafts, which are geared together, and each of which has, running loose on it, a pinion which gears into a rack formed round the edge of the mash-tun. Each shaft, also, carries a sliding clutch for connectiug it to its pinion, and these clutches are both worked by one lever, arranged as shown in the plan, so that either can be thrown in gear at pleasure, but so that they cannot be engaged simultaneously. One of the pinion shafts extends inwards towards the centre of the mash-tun, and at its inner end it carries a bevel wheel, which gears into a bevel pinion on the central shaft, this pinion being about one-third the size of the wheel. The rake shafts also carry bevel wheels, which gear into equal sized wheels on the vertical shaft, the pairs of wheels being arranged so that the two rake shafts are both made to revolve in the same direction.

Anyway, on the way to the test, Gavin asked a very important question.

I don’t know why.” My mommy rally speech went a little something like this: “That’s completely normal, buddy. Mommy is scared to do things all the time and I feel just like that, but I do them anyway. Like when mommy spoke at that school recently, I was nervous, but I didn’t let it stop me. I did it anyway, and the more you do stuff like that, even when you feel nervous, the easier it is to do more things like that. Then you get really good at it.”

Raw honey is a great food to eat in the spring to help clear your sinuses and mucus glands. But you must buy local raw honey to really reap the benefits for your own regions seasonal allergens.

And you are gunna need it after you try one of these....you just can't stop after one!
I think week four was the worst, in a general sense. Two of the seven days were terrible runs, but the bright side is I totally learned a lesson. Apparently it was an important one, because I made the same mistake twice. I think God might have been telling me something here?

Pielke has also told the IPCC that citing one section of Muir-Wood’s paper in preference to the rest of his work, and all the other peer-reviewed literature, was wrong. He said: “All the literature published before and since the IPCC report shows that rising disaster losses can be explained entirely by social change. People have looked hard for evidence that global warming plays a part but can’t find it. Muir-Wood’s study actually confirmed that.”

These energized sun particles have a combined force equal in some cases to a CME. They can cause magnetic storms of such magnitude that they overload power lines with excess current, and cause widespread blackouts. One of these events happened in September 1859 when a solar flare lasted nearly a week. Most of Middle America was without power for that period. It is remembered in astronomical and meteorological circles as the Superstorm or the Carrington Event.

So, yeah. I was going to post yesterday, and somehow I realized it was like 10 pm and I had nothing to say except Holy Smokes, I'm Tired, and that just didn't seem like it was something worthwhile, so I kept it to myself.
On an unassuming block of the 9th arrondissement in Paris, obscured by thick curtains over the windows and door, Le Chateaubriand could easily go unnoticed, if not for the crowd gathered around outside from about 8-12 each evening. The curtains tell you, “we don’t care if you come in or not”, in that nonchalant “bobo” fashion that only Paris pulls off so well.

Snared and frightened, Dupic resisted the monk's inhuman strength by attempting to flap his wings and fly away, but the pious pervert was too strong. Determined to reach Cupid, he drew from the reserves deep within his half-soul and dragged the now naked monk with him, closer to his hypnotized brother and Cyberon.

You may have read a recent article in PW called "Self-Published Titles Topped 764,000 in 2009 as Traditional Output Dipped," about the amazing growth in "non-traditional" (a.k.a. print-on-demand-produced) books.
And another thing, I’m American. I’m very glad you did a couple of episodes in America, that was great. I’ve also seen that you are doing more shooting in America for the 7th series. But please, whatever you do, do NOT try to Americanize Doctor Who! I’m rather upset already that Matt Smith’s Doctor hasn’t even been to London yet (unless you count that alternative timeline London). What’s up with that? I miss London. I’ve never been there in real life, so I have, in the past, used Doctor Who’s travels to London as a vicarious visitation. So, I’m ready to go back there, please.

So my ideas for blogging are all clumped together inside all the other thoughts that are roaming around my head. Hopefully, this is the beginning of me sorting them out.
I really admire the style of artists such as Roben-Marie Smith, Donna Downey and Traci Bautista. I like their wild and colourful freestyle attitude and as I said recently, it is a real chance for me to just play and express myself next to all the DT work.
Overall, the place is fun, nicely designed and promises to be a sure-thing address for a majority of both the after-work and night-crawling crowd. While not every bar in town is obligated to make a decent martini, that's my thing. So even if I really like the space, I gotta call them out on their cocktails. With the vague rumors I continue to hear about behind the scene decisions here, I believe it will take a little time before le Pompon works out the drink kinks and hits full stride as either a place serving really good cocktails or your basic beer and well drinks. In the meantime, they're worth a visit for a pint and some good music.

I always enjoy visiting with Pete. He said he and his wife will be at the concert Saturday to hear my new "Fire & Ice" song. Which, in a flurry of techiness, I burned to a CD for him to play on the air as a sneak preview of the concert. Which, of course, didn't work when he tried to play it.

'A milestone'
Another classic early 70s album from Marcos Valle, But, this album took a little while to grow on me. Perhaps because, when I'm obsessively-compulsively collecting, consuming, and divulging music, I am busy worshiping the Dark One, Satanáis, Beelzebub, Lucifer, or Jimmy Witherspoon - I am a little put off by the opening track on this one, 'Jesus Meu Rei.' On the other hand, there is an apocryphal and even millenarian streak to a lot of the content on this album. Satan may have granted me the power to acquire gluttunous amounts of music over the years, but far be if from me to question The Brothers Valle if their faith is strong. It's a gorgeous baroque pop tune with whispy harpsichord and strummy acoustic guitar and very, um, "churchy" organ from none other than Dom Salvador. Then tuning into the lyrics and I am surprised, in spite of knowing that I shouldn't be, of Paulo Sérgios genius. In its hymnal piety the song also calls on Jesus to look around at how the world has changed, and ambiguous lines that can either be a lament of world gone down the wrong path, or perhaps a plea to some type of moral relativity adn realism ("nada e ninguem / sabe o que é mal / e o que é bem / Jesus meu rei / fazendo lei / Passa seu tempo real"). A chorus of voices that's built since the first verse swells into the transcendent bridge and the softly provocative lines:
You’ve always been there for me.

I’d say that you might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true. But you might not have heard that I became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people. You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons. And I’d tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson. And after 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery!

The only complaint I have is small, and that is the quality of the poems’ printing – they’re a bit blurry. However interesting issues arise here concerning reproduction, distribution, and the existence of the image; and thus the poem/book: where/what is the original? And if this lurks somewhere on a computer, as an intangible sequence of ones and zeroes – what, then, are the implications?

She brings me a small plastic shopping basket being "pulled" by a Barbie horse harnessed in yarn. She has found some flattened boxes in our recycling to use for the wheels. We cut off thick strips and wrap them around a drinking glass to make them the same size. Then we glue the edges. A problem, though, is the axle. We have chopsticks for the axle. But what about the spokes to attach the wheels to the axle?
In closing my interview, I asked Jeanne if there was anything left on her list of things she wanted to do given her long list of accomplishments to date as television journalist, as well as author and editor. She answered "I'd like to return to the places I've been to for work that I didn't get a chance to explore on my own, but really what I look forward to doing in this next chapter is to continue doing a lot of things that I have done, but just do them better. I want to continue to make great television - but better; I want to write more books - but better." When I told her that she must have a wicked perfectionist streak because so many people look up to her and admire her that I cannot imagine her having to do anything better, she said "Sometimes I feel like I've barely scratched the surface in terms of my potential. I am turning 60 next year and that only gives me another 20-30 years to go, but who knows. Diana Vreeland didn't start editing Vogue until she was 60". I left utterly enchanted by Jeanne and her zest for life.

At least, there was no line for buying a ticket. There was a long line for getting autographs. I wasn't sure that I wanted any because a.) getting an autograph costs a lot more than it used to, and b.) I wasn't sure if I wanted to stand in this line. So I went off in search of something else to do, thinking that the line would go down some and I might do it later.

Life is too short to be spent in judgment of others.
A few days later my whole world went colorless. I couldn't figure out what the hell happened. I was walking along my merry way and then all of the sudden, I couldn't see colors anymore. I was sad, missed my mom, and was a permanent fixture on the couch. Once Dirty said this all started because Hanks and I couldn't be friends anymore, I got defensive. There was NO way I'm THIS sad because a friend of mine who isn't THAT important in my life said we can't hang anymore! "What kind of person does that make me?" I seriously questioned EVERYTHING! I questioned my marriage, my feelings for Dirty, my feelings for Hanks, my mom's death, myself, everything! I wondered if I had some serious feelings for Hanks that I didn't know about. It wasn't easy but I told all of this to Dirty. I felt if something was going on with me, he had to know. This is our future! He took it well, probably because I was so pathetic and crying and knew exactly what was going on. He let me spill my guts and then told me, that and Hanks "breaking up" was just a trigger. "You two are friends, you guys text and hang out, it's a loss, even if it's a small one. But this is triggering the feelings of your mom's death." Well hell! I didn't even think about it that way and why would I? My mind was just blank and I felt so dead inside.
Breakfast would be waiting and it would be eaten under the watchful eyes of one of the aunts. A large plate filled with the fluffiest biscuits, smothered in butter and homemade jam, and lots of milk gravy.

The most profound usage of the olive tree in the Bible, however, is in relation to the Lord’s plan of redemption, and the Church. Romans 11:17-21 17 “If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.”

Part of Catherine’s award is a bursary of $10,000 which she is using to run “Influential Women” forums with her partner Elizabeth Brennan to build capacity and confidence in rural women to empower them to engage and build consumer/producer relationships. Catherine is committed to encouraging rural women to celebrate the roles that they play in agriculture, communicate more effectively with the consumer and each other and collaborate between industries to speak and act with a united voice. She is hoping the forums will also act as a conduit into other leadership programs.
As you can see, I had quite a mess because I decided to pull all the yarn out of it’s nice little roll so that I could cut it off: I do not recommend this! It got all knotted and messy and would be much easier if you just pulled it straight from the little ball of yarn. (See, you can tell I’m not a knitter, I don’t even know what to call the ball of yarn.)
Many times in my life I have asked the question, “What does God want of me?” Moses tells me that God wants me to walk in his ways and serve him with my heart and soul. I should thank God that he has made plain will for me and that he will help me to do it.
This time around on first taste the flavor was the familiar profile, bready and creamy smooth, but the finish seemed surprisingly bitter, not hops bitter, just bitter. As I progressed with my glass the bitterness remained and even arrived a little earlier in the profile. It was a much different beer then I had last time. I suspect the problem was my lunch which I had a couple of hours earlier, pork chops with a mango-tomato salsa. I’m thinking the beer picked up the acid left from the fruit and had an adverse reaction to it. Don’t get me wrong, even this way Triple XB wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t the same, so time to track down a third bottle.
Your voice matters. They say that actions speak louder than words, but words can inspire if they are based on actions. Put the two together, your actions and your words and they will add value to each other. If people are watching your actions and hearing your words, they will begin to do the things you do. This will have a multiplying effect over time. “Why bother,” because your voice matters when it is coupled with actions that are based on your involvement. If you were not born a millionaire or born into royalty; you will have to build it from the ground up. How much you get done depends on how much of a team you have around you. I used to like to watch that T.V. show where they could tear down and rebuild a house in a week. Can’t do that by yourself, you need a team; and your team needs to see that you are willing to back your words with your actions.

This is the last thing that I would like to discuss. Firstly the name – are they transfers or Proof of Payment (POP). Depending on where you are, or what you are doing they can be either. My feeling is that they should be called POP. Because that is what they are. And it should be expected that all passengers be required to have a POP (not unlike the GO transit system in and around the GTA). It can be used to transfer from one vehicle to another – but its main purpose is to show that you paid to be on the system.

Sương Sáo aka Grass Jelly is a dessert/drink popular throughout Southeast Asia. According to Chinese medicine it has "cooling" properties and is good for the skin. Grass Jelly is actually made from a dried herb that is a member of the mint family...not grass as the name suggests. The herb's name in Chinese which is "len fan chou" (cooling grass). Thus, jelly made from cooling grass is....you guessed it Grass Jelly.

Today, in part of our discussions I talked about the fact that we need to know who we are in Christ and operate according to the royalty we are. We have the full authority and power of Jesus. I mentioned that it even says that those who are followers of Christ will be able to do everything and even more than Jesus had done (John 14:12). So then, to make it practical I asked, “How many of you have prayed for the sick and seen them get well.” A few raised their hands. “Great,” I responded, “that means you are walking in royalty. You are doing what Jesus did.” So then I ventured further in my questioning, expecting a negative reply, and said, “How many of you have raised the dead?”

Two years later in a psychology lecture I noticed that a certain boy that had caught my eye throughout my time at university was sitting three rows in front of me. After class, my best friend (who would later be my Maid of Honour at our wedding) pointedly introduced me to him. Thus began my introduction to the Chinese language and the culture of Taiwan, although I had no idea at the time. I was too busy getting lost in his dreamy brown eyes to even think about what I was going to eat for lunch, let alone what the ramifications of falling in love with someone of a different culture would be.

These intimate personal conversations with Rufus’ own family in these two songs should not leave the impression that there is a dominant heavy and gloomy sound to the album. Yes, that sound is definitely to tumble on and there is a melancholic tune to some of the songs. However, it is a moving collection of many unexpected pieces that are successfully combined into one consistent album…An album that turns into a musical open buffet, worthwhile to listen to at least to hear how Rufus would meet the sound of an earlier epoch.
He has a problem with the idea that “the state doesn’t have rights to limit individuals’ wants and passions.” Notice he doesn’t say the state has a right to limit how you act on your wants and passions (which it does if said wants and passions hurt another person)…but he actually said the state can legislate your wants and passions. Your thoughts and feelings. What you usually think of when you hear the terms “Thought Crimes” or “Big Brother” are nothing compared to what Santorum wants. Not even entitled to the sanctity of your own mind. Nope, the government can legislate that too.

Nothing horrifying has ever happened to me, but I did embarrass myself big time with Richard Price. I am a huge fan of his and have read everything he’s written. When he visited Powell’s, I wasn’t doing my blog yet and was just there as a fan. He seemed very nervous while he was reading. His knuckles were white where they grasped the lectern. He wasn’t happy with some of the audience questions about his books being made into movies either. I should have picked up on all this, but unfortunately I was too excited about meeting him to notice, except in retrospect. When I got to the signing table, he asked me a question, which I thought for some insane reason was, “Are you a writer?” I was like, Wow! He wants to talk about life and the world of writing, so I started rambling. At one point I even said, “I’m a writer and I’m working on a novel but it’s not going very well.” When I finally checked back into reality, I realized he was looking at me with what can only be described as supreme pity and then he said rather curtly, “Could you please just tell me what you want me to write in your book.” All he had wanted was my name so he could inscribe my book. He wrote something and I ran. Later, I saw he had written, “To Diane, You will find a writing job.” If I ever have the chance to

But, the healing of that long, angry scar is not the biggest change. Rather, at least for now, the irritations that used to send me into orbit seem inconsequential.

Mark Morrisroe (1 gelatin silver, 1987)
During the summer, it just doesn't seem this way. Everyone is happy, the house stays clean, and it takes less time to get things done! In the winter it takes so much more effort! Maybe because in the winter the only way things feel relaxing is sitting in a candle lit clean house, with a hot cup of tea watching a movie or reading a book. In the winter everyone plays inside all day long, and that relaxing setting is non-existent some days!
It’s fitting, then, that the other major news story of the day was the handing down of several suspensions to the players that were involved in the Saints’ Bountygate scandal. (Johnathan Vilma – full season, Anthony Hargrove – eight game, Will Smith – four games, Scott Fujita – three games.)
Anticipation seems to be a universal of all living things. Cats wait outside the mouse-hole, squirrels bury nuts for the winter, birds build nests for the expected new arrivals. We humans with our expanded mental abilities quite possibly are capable of more anticipation than any other living organism. As children we count the almost-infinite number of days to Christmas, or the interminable hours spent in the back seat of the car until we’re finally there.

As I mentioned in America's Failed Russian Putsch , the American actions are acts of war, blatant acts of war. If it came to light that Russia, China or Germany had flooded one or another of the US parties with foreign cash, the scandal would never quiet down and that same Jabbering fool McCain would be singing "Bomb, bomb (fill in nation's name)".
I don’t know the context in which the music is used… I never finished watching season one and I may have seen the relevant episode already, but I can’t remember.

The Barnes & Noble reader is just told that this book is for ages 12 and up according to CommonSenseMedia. (For the record? I've given it to my 9 year old niece, who will read it if and when she gets through all the Warrior books). If the parent clicks "more" they will get the reasons for the 12 plus rating. Barnes & Noble gives the publisher age range (ironically, ages 9 to 12, which I agree with). If the parent reads to Editorial Reviews (but why should they, when they aren't highlighted as CommonSenseMedia does?), they get a variety of ages: ten and up from Publishers Weekly; grades 5 to 8 from School Library Journal; ages ten to fourteen from Kirkus.
Let me first dispel a common misconception about world building and writing speculative fiction. You have to do research! Yes, the world that you are creating is yours, and yes the rules are different from those of the normal world. However, any speculative fiction world must be close enough to the real world to engender familiarity. If you don’t do any research, and you wind up putting jungle plants in the desert, or ignoring the fact that human’s can’t breath in a vacuum, then your readers will notice. Even minor things, like forgetting that sound doesn’t travel in space (and thus you can’t hear explosions), or forgetting that eagles ride rising thermal air instead of flapping their wings to stay a loft, will be noticed. In fact, often times small mistakes are harder to dismiss than big ones. For instance, if I write a story in which human’s can breath in space (as ridiculous as it is), a reader is much more likely to accept this and keep reading than that same reader is to accept a single mention of an eagle flapping its way through the sky. Huge changes are expected in speculative fiction (i.e. magic, spaceships, laser pistols, elves, dwarfs, etc), and so a huge but consistent change is fairly easy to swallow, it is within the readers grasp. However, a mistake from lack of research (i.e a single mention of a broad-leafed plant in the desert or a man in 1975 with a cell phone) will set your reader’s eyes to rolling and that’s when they stop caring. Be creative, and be bold, but do your research and don’t be stupid. If you want to make a people group that trains falcons to deliver messages, that’s fine, but if everyone uses pigeons except for the one random person who has a falcon that you somehow forgot to mention before, that people will notice.
It's hard to believe that we have two children now. But, at the same time, it seems completely natural. I know things will get easier once Connor is on a normal schedule and I can get some sleep in the evenings.
Sorry excuse for a man, Beck thought with contempt as the two remaining straws were held up for his choosing. Without looking away from his fidgeting engineer, Damien lowered the pistol and drew a straw.

Of course, all of the other elements still applied, and became the focus of my ‘strategic goals’. They are, at present:
I cut the scalloped banner parts from craft cardstock and added a straight part from pink cardstock, sewing both of these layers together with my sewing machine.
The best one was called Havanna. It’s known for being one of the finest alfajores brands, it’s café is top notch as well.
“Passengers on the ocean steamers caught a glimpse of him on their way up the channel and were impressed by the ponderosity of American institutions. They were bound to admire the majesty of his proportions just as they were compelled to express appreciation of the solemnity of his mien. It was not, however, to the plaudits of the better element that he chiefly appealed. He did not care much for the adulation of those who had tasted the civilization of European cities, or even of those who had become jaded with the excesses of our own metropolitan existence. What he especially reveled in was the gaze of the guileless, that of the inhabitants of our rural districts, who regarded him as the personification of all the virtues of city life.
And really, what better way is there to celebrate menstrual laws than with red velvet? (Because I assure you that one does not survive a year of niddah without a sense of humor.) So I went looking for a recipe and I found this one. Sometimes it nice to just doctor a mix, and this recipe did not disappoint. They actually reminded me more of cupcake tops than cookies in their texture, but either way, they were delicious and devoured by many a hungry Jewish seminarian. Purity and cookies for all!
God evening friends!
